# Directory Descriptions:

1. **cmd/allocator/main.go**:
   - This is the entry point of the application. It initializes the allocator and calls the necessary functions to manage user demands, allocate resources, and apply credits.
   
2. **internal/allocator**:
   - **allocator.go**: Contains the main implementation of the Karma allocator, with methods like `add_user()`, `update_demand()`, and `allocate()`.
   - **credits.go**: Functions that convert Karma credits to monetary value and manage the application of those credits.
   - **api.go**: Functions to interact with the cloud billing APIs (AWS and GCP) for applying credits or budget adjustments.

3. **internal/cloud**:
   - **aws.go**: Contains code to integrate with AWS billing APIs (e.g., using AWS SDK for Go).
   - **gcp.go**: Contains code to integrate with GCP billing APIs (e.g., using Google Cloud SDK for Go).

4. **pkg/utils/helper.go**:
   - Contains helper functions that are used across the project, such as error handling, validation, or formatting utilities.

5. **configs/config.yaml**:
   - Configuration file containing settings like the value of `alpha`, initial credits, API keys, cloud credentials, etc. It allows easy adjustments without modifying the code.

6. **scripts/apply_credits.py**:
   - Optional Python script to apply credits using cloud SDKs if a Go-based approach isn't feasible for certain interactions.

7. **test/**:
   - **allocator_test.go**: Unit tests for the core allocator logic, ensuring that resource allocation and user credit updates are handled correctly.
   - **credits_test.go**: Tests for functions that convert credits to monetary value and interact with cloud billing APIs.

8. **go.mod**:
   - Go module file, specifying project dependencies.

9. **README.md**:
   - Documentation explaining the project, its structure, how to set up the environment, configuration details, and how to run the project.
