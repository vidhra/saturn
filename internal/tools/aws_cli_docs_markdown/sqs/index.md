## Description

Welcome to the *Amazon SQS API Reference* .

Amazon SQS is a reliable, highly-scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between applications or microservices. Amazon SQS moves data between distributed application components and helps you decouple these components.

For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see [Identity and access management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-authentication-and-access-control.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide.*

You can use [Amazon Web Services SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk) to access Amazon SQS using your favorite programming language. The SDKs perform tasks such as the following automatically:

- Cryptographically sign your service requests
- Retry requests
- Handle error responses
