# batch-import-findings

## Description

Imports security findings generated by a finding provider into Security Hub. This action is requested by the finding provider to import its findings into Security Hub.

`BatchImportFindings` must be called by one of the following:

- The Amazon Web Services account that is associated with a finding if you are using the [default product ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-custom-providers.html#securityhub-custom-providers-bfi-reqs) or are a partner sending findings from within a customerâs Amazon Web Services account. In these cases, the identifier of the account that you are calling `BatchImportFindings` from needs to be the same as the `AwsAccountId` attribute for the finding.
- An Amazon Web Services account that Security Hub has allow-listed for an official partner integration. In this case, you can call `BatchImportFindings` from the allow-listed account and send findings from different customer accounts in the same batch.

The maximum allowed size for a finding is 240 Kb. An error is returned for any finding larger than 240 Kb.

After a finding is created, `BatchImportFindings` cannot be used to update the following finding fields and objects, which Security Hub customers use to manage their investigation workflow.

- `Note`
- `UserDefinedFields`
- `VerificationState`
- `Workflow`

Finding providers also should not use `BatchImportFindings` to update the following attributes.

- `Confidence`
- `Criticality`
- `RelatedFindings`
- `Severity`
- `Types`

Instead, finding providers use `FindingProviderFields` to provide values for these attributes.

- `NEW` - The initial state of a finding, before it is reviewed. Security Hub also resets the workflow status from `NOTIFIED` or `RESOLVED` to `NEW` in the following cases:
- `RecordState` changes from `ARCHIVED` to `ACTIVE` .
- `ComplianceStatus` changes from `PASSED` to either `WARNING` , `FAILED` , or `NOT_AVAILABLE` .
- `NOTIFIED` - Indicates that you notified the resource owner about the security issue. Used when the initial reviewer is not the resource owner, and needs intervention from the resource owner.
- `SUPPRESSED` - Indicates that you reviewed the finding and donât believe that any action is needed. The finding is no longer updated.
- `RESOLVED` - The finding was reviewed and remediated and is now considered resolved.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To update a finding**

The following `batch-import-findings` example updates a finding.

```
aws securityhub batch-import-findings \
     --findings '
        [{
            "AwsAccountId": "123456789012",
            "CreatedAt": "2020-05-27T17:05:54.832Z",
            "Description": "Vulnerability in a CloudTrail trail",

Output:

```

    "FailedCount": 0,
    "SuccessCount": 1,
    "FailedFindings": []
}
```
