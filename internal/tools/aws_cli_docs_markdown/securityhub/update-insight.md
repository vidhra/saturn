## Options

`--insight-arn` (string)

The ARN of the insight that you want to update.

`--name` (string)

The updated name for the insight.

`--filters` (structure)

The updated filters that define this insight.

ProductArn -> (list)

The ARN generated by Security Hub that uniquely identifies a third-party company (security findings provider) after this providerâs product (solution that generates findings) is registered with Security Hub.

(structure)

A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

Value -> (string)

The string filter value. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, the product name for control-based findings is `Security Hub` . If you provide `security hub` as the filter value, thereâs no match.

Comparison -> (string)

The condition to apply to a string value when filtering Security Hub findings.

To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that includes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID of `123456789012` .
- To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesnât match.

`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
- To search for values that donât start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .

`NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

You can combine `PREFIX` filters with `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the `PREFIX` filters, and then the `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters.

For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of `AwsIamPolicy` and findings that have a resource type of `AwsEc2NetworkInterface` .

- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`
- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface`

`CONTAINS` and `NOT_CONTAINS` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *Security Hub User Guide* .

AwsAccountId -> (list)

- To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesnât match.

`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.

(structure)

A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

Value -> (string)

The string filter value. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, the product name for control-based findings is `Security Hub` . If you provide `security hub` as the filter value, thereâs no match.

Comparison -> (string)

The condition to apply to a string value when filtering Security Hub findings.

To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that includes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID of `123456789012` .
- To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesnât match.

`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
- To search for values that donât start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .

`NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

You can combine `PREFIX` filters with `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the `PREFIX` filters, and then the `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters.

For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of `AwsIamPolicy` and findings that have a resource type of `AwsEc2NetworkInterface` .

- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`
- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface`

`CONTAINS` and `NOT_CONTAINS` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *Security Hub User Guide* .

ProductFields -> (list)

A data type where security findings providers can include additional solution-specific details that arenât part of the defined `AwsSecurityFinding` format.

(structure)

A map filter for filtering Security Hub findings. Each map filter provides the field to check for, the value to check for, and the comparison operator.

Key -> (string)

The key of the map filter. For example, for `ResourceTags` , `Key` identifies the name of the tag. For `UserDefinedFields` , `Key` is the name of the field.

Value -> (string)

The value for the key in the map filter. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a tag called `Department` might be `Security` . If you provide `security` as the filter value, then thereâs no match.

Comparison -> (string)

The condition to apply to the key value when filtering Security Hub findings with a map filter.

To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department CONTAINS Security` matches findings that include the value `Security` for the `Department` tag. In the same example, a finding with a value of `Security team` for the `Department` tag is a match.
- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department EQUALS Security` matches findings that have the value `Security` for the `Department` tag.

`CONTAINS` and `EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Department CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance` match a finding that includes either `Security` , `Finance` , or both values.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance` matches findings that exclude the value `Finance` for the `Department` tag.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department NOT_EQUALS Finance` matches findings that donât have the value `Finance` for the `Department` tag.

`NOT_CONTAINS` and `NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Department NOT_CONTAINS Security AND Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance` match a finding that excludes both the `Security` and `Finance` values.

`CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât have both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.

- To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesnât match.

`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
- To search for values that donât start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .

`NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

You can combine `PREFIX` filters with `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the `PREFIX` filters, and then the `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters.

For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of `AwsIamPolicy` and findings that have a resource type of `AwsEc2NetworkInterface` .

- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`
- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface`

`CONTAINS` and `NOT_CONTAINS` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *Security Hub User Guide* .

UserDefinedFields -> (list)

A list of name/value string pairs associated with the finding. These are custom, user-defined fields added to a finding.

(structure)

A map filter for filtering Security Hub findings. Each map filter provides the field to check for, the value to check for, and the comparison operator.

Key -> (string)

The key of the map filter. For example, for `ResourceTags` , `Key` identifies the name of the tag. For `UserDefinedFields` , `Key` is the name of the field.

Value -> (string)

The value for the key in the map filter. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a tag called `Department` might be `Security` . If you provide `security` as the filter value, then thereâs no match.

Comparison -> (string)

The condition to apply to the key value when filtering Security Hub findings with a map filter.

To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department CONTAINS Security` matches findings that include the value `Security` for the `Department` tag. In the same example, a finding with a value of `Security team` for the `Department` tag is a match.
- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department EQUALS Security` matches findings that have the value `Security` for the `Department` tag.

`CONTAINS` and `EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Department CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance` match a finding that includes either `Security` , `Finance` , or both values.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance` matches findings that exclude the value `Finance` for the `Department` tag.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department NOT_EQUALS Finance` matches findings that donât have the value `Finance` for the `Department` tag.

`NOT_CONTAINS` and `NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Department NOT_CONTAINS Security AND Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance` match a finding that excludes both the `Security` and `Finance` values.

`CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât have both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.

(structure)

A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

Value -> (string)

The string filter value. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, the product name for control-based findings is `Security Hub` . If you provide `security hub` as the filter value, thereâs no match.

Comparison -> (string)

The condition to apply to a string value when filtering Security Hub findings.

To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that includes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID of `123456789012` .
- To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesnât match.

`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
- To search for values that donât start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .

`NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

You can combine `PREFIX` filters with `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the `PREFIX` filters, and then the `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters.

For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of `AwsIamPolicy` and findings that have a resource type of `AwsEc2NetworkInterface` .

- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`
- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface`

`CONTAINS` and `NOT_CONTAINS` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *Security Hub User Guide* .

NetworkSourceMac -> (list)

- To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesnât match.

`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
- To search for values that donât start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .

`NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
- To search for values that donât start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .

`NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

You can combine `PREFIX` filters with `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the `PREFIX` filters, and then the `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters.

For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of `AwsIamPolicy` and findings that have a resource type of `AwsEc2NetworkInterface` .

- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`
- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface`

`CONTAINS` and `NOT_CONTAINS` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *Security Hub User Guide* .

ThreatIntelIndicatorCategory -> (list)

The category of a threat intelligence indicator.

(structure)

A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

Value -> (string)

Comparison -> (string)

The condition to apply to a string value when filtering Security Hub findings.

To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that includes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID of `123456789012` .
- To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesnât match.

`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.

- To search for values that donât start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .

`NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

You can combine `PREFIX` filters with `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the `PREFIX` filters, and then the `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters.

For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of `AwsIamPolicy` and findings that have a resource type of `AwsEc2NetworkInterface` .

- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`
- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface`

ResourceTags -> (list)

A list of Amazon Web Services tags associated with a resource at the time the finding was processed.

(structure)

A map filter for filtering Security Hub findings. Each map filter provides the field to check for, the value to check for, and the comparison operator.

Key -> (string)

The key of the map filter. For example, for `ResourceTags` , `Key` identifies the name of the tag. For `UserDefinedFields` , `Key` is the name of the field.

Value -> (string)

The value for the key in the map filter. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a tag called `Department` might be `Security` . If you provide `security` as the filter value, then thereâs no match.

Comparison -> (string)

The condition to apply to the key value when filtering Security Hub findings with a map filter.

To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department CONTAINS Security` matches findings that include the value `Security` for the `Department` tag. In the same example, a finding with a value of `Security team` for the `Department` tag is a match.
- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department EQUALS Security` matches findings that have the value `Security` for the `Department` tag.

`CONTAINS` and `EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Department CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance` match a finding that includes either `Security` , `Finance` , or both values.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance` matches findings that exclude the value `Finance` for the `Department` tag.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department NOT_EQUALS Finance` matches findings that donât have the value `Finance` for the `Department` tag.

`NOT_CONTAINS` and `NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Department NOT_CONTAINS Security AND Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance` match a finding that excludes both the `Security` and `Finance` values.

`CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât have both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.

ResourceAwsEc2InstanceType -> (list)

The instance type of the instance.

(structure)

A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

Value -> (string)

The string filter value. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, the product name for control-based findings is `Security Hub` . If you provide `security hub` as the filter value, thereâs no match.

Comparison -> (string)

The condition to apply to a string value when filtering Security Hub findings.

To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that includes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID of `123456789012` .
- To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesnât match.

`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
- To search for values that donât start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .

`NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

- To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesnât match.

`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
- To search for values that donât start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .

`NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

You can combine `PREFIX` filters with `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the `PREFIX` filters, and then the `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters.

For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of `AwsIamPolicy` and findings that have a resource type of `AwsEc2NetworkInterface` .

- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`
- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface`

`CONTAINS` and `NOT_CONTAINS` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *Security Hub User Guide* .

ResourceAwsS3BucketOwnerName -> (list)

The display name of the owner of the S3 bucket.

(structure)

A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

Value -> (string)

The string filter value. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, the product name for control-based findings is `Security Hub` . If you provide `security hub` as the filter value, thereâs no match.

Comparison -> (string)

The condition to apply to a string value when filtering Security Hub findings.

To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that includes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID of `123456789012` .
- To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesnât match.

`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
- To search for values that donât start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .

`NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

You can combine `PREFIX` filters with `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the `PREFIX` filters, and then the `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters.

For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of `AwsIamPolicy` and findings that have a resource type of `AwsEc2NetworkInterface` .

- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`
- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface`

For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

You can combine `PREFIX` filters with `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the `PREFIX` filters, and then the `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters.

For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of `AwsIamPolicy` and findings that have a resource type of `AwsEc2NetworkInterface` .

- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`
- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface`

ResourceContainerImageName -> (list)

The name of the image related to a finding.

(structure)

A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

Value -> (string)

The string filter value. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, the product name for control-based findings is `Security Hub` . If you provide `security hub` as the filter value, thereâs no match.

Comparison -> (string)

The condition to apply to a string value when filtering Security Hub findings.

To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that includes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID of `123456789012` .
- To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesnât match.

`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
- To search for values that donât start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .

`NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

You can combine `PREFIX` filters with `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the `PREFIX` filters, and then the `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters.

For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of `AwsIamPolicy` and findings that have a resource type of `AwsEc2NetworkInterface` .

- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`
- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface`

`CONTAINS` and `NOT_CONTAINS` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *Security Hub User Guide* .

ResourceContainerLaunchedAt -> (list)

(structure)

A map filter for filtering Security Hub findings. Each map filter provides the field to check for, the value to check for, and the comparison operator.

Key -> (string)

The key of the map filter. For example, for `ResourceTags` , `Key` identifies the name of the tag. For `UserDefinedFields` , `Key` is the name of the field.

Value -> (string)

The value for the key in the map filter. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a tag called `Department` might be `Security` . If you provide `security` as the filter value, then thereâs no match.

Comparison -> (string)

The condition to apply to the key value when filtering Security Hub findings with a map filter.

To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department CONTAINS Security` matches findings that include the value `Security` for the `Department` tag. In the same example, a finding with a value of `Security team` for the `Department` tag is a match.
- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department EQUALS Security` matches findings that have the value `Security` for the `Department` tag.

`CONTAINS` and `EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Department CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance` match a finding that includes either `Security` , `Finance` , or both values.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance` matches findings that exclude the value `Finance` for the `Department` tag.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department NOT_EQUALS Finance` matches findings that donât have the value `Finance` for the `Department` tag.

`NOT_CONTAINS` and `NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Department NOT_CONTAINS Security AND Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance` match a finding that excludes both the `Security` and `Finance` values.

`CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât have both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.

WorkflowStatus -> (list)

The status of the investigation into a finding. Allowed values are the following.

- `NEW` - The initial state of a finding, before it is reviewed. Security Hub also resets the workflow status from `NOTIFIED` or `RESOLVED` to `NEW` in the following cases:
- `RecordState` changes from `ARCHIVED` to `ACTIVE` .
- `Compliance.Status` changes from `PASSED` to either `WARNING` , `FAILED` , or `NOT_AVAILABLE` .
- `NOTIFIED` - Indicates that the resource owner has been notified about the security issue. Used when the initial reviewer is not the resource owner, and needs intervention from the resource owner. If one of the following occurs, the workflow status is changed automatically from `NOTIFIED` to `NEW` :
- `RecordState` changes from `ARCHIVED` to `ACTIVE` .
- `Compliance.Status` changes from `PASSED` to `FAILED` , `WARNING` , or `NOT_AVAILABLE` .
- `SUPPRESSED` - Indicates that you reviewed the finding and donât believe that any action is needed. The workflow status of a `SUPPRESSED` finding does not change if `RecordState` changes from `ARCHIVED` to `ACTIVE` .
- `RESOLVED` - The finding was reviewed and remediated and is now considered resolved.  The finding remains `RESOLVED` unless one of the following occurs:
- `RecordState` changes from `ARCHIVED` to `ACTIVE` .
- `Compliance.Status` changes from `PASSED` to `FAILED` , `WARNING` , or `NOT_AVAILABLE` .

In those cases, the workflow status is automatically reset to `NEW` .

For findings from controls, if `Compliance.Status` is `PASSED` , then Security Hub automatically sets the workflow status to `RESOLVED` .

RelatedFindingsProductArn -> (list)

The ARN of the solution that generated a related finding.

(structure)

A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

Value -> (string)

The string filter value. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, the product name for control-based findings is `Security Hub` . If you provide `security hub` as the filter value, thereâs no match.

Comparison -> (string)

The condition to apply to a string value when filtering Security Hub findings.

To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that includes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID of `123456789012` .
- To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesnât match.

`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
- To search for values that donât start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .

`NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

You can combine `PREFIX` filters with `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the `PREFIX` filters, and then the `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters.

For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of `AwsIamPolicy` and findings that have a resource type of `AwsEc2NetworkInterface` .

- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`
- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface`

`CONTAINS` and `NOT_CONTAINS` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *Security Hub User Guide* .

FindingProviderFieldsSeverityOriginal -> (list)

The finding providerâs original value for the severity.

(structure)

A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

Value -> (string)

The string filter value. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, the product name for control-based findings is `Security Hub` . If you provide `security hub` as the filter value, thereâs no match.

Comparison -> (string)

The condition to apply to a string value when filtering Security Hub findings.

To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that includes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID of `123456789012` .
- To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesnât match.

`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
- To search for values that donât start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .

`NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

You can combine `PREFIX` filters with `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the `PREFIX` filters, and then the `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters.

For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of `AwsIamPolicy` and findings that have a resource type of `AwsEc2NetworkInterface` .

- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`
- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface`

(structure)

A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

Value -> (string)

The string filter value. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, the product name for control-based findings is `Security Hub` . If you provide `security hub` as the filter value, thereâs no match.

Comparison -> (string)

The condition to apply to a string value when filtering Security Hub findings.

To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID of `123456789012` .
- To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesnât match.

`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
- To search for values that donât start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .

`NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field.

- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID of `123456789012` .
- To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesnât match.

`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
- To search for values that donât start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .

`NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

You canât have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you canât provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

You can combine `PREFIX` filters with `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the `PREFIX` filters, and then the `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters.

For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of `AwsIamPolicy` and findings that have a resource type of `AwsEc2NetworkInterface` .

- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`
- `ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy`
- `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface`

`CONTAINS` and `NOT_CONTAINS` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *Security Hub User Guide* .

AwsAccountName -> (list)

The name of the Amazon Web Services account in which a finding is generated.

(structure)

A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

Value -> (string)

The string filter value. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, the product name for control-based findings is `Security Hub` . If you provide `security hub` as the filter value, thereâs no match.

Comparison -> (string)

The condition to apply to a string value when filtering Security Hub findings.

To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that includes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID of `123456789012` .

`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.

To search for values that donât have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:

- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
- To search for values that donât start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .

`NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.

`--group-by-attribute` (string)

The updated `GroupBy` attribute that defines this insight.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**Example 1: To change the filter for a custom insight**

The following `update-insight` example changes the filters for a custom insight. The updated insight looks for findings with a high severity that are related to AWS roles.

```
aws securityhub update-insight \
    --insight-arn "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:insight/123456789012/custom/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111" \
    --filters '{"ResourceType": [{ "Comparison": "EQUALS", "Value": "AwsIamRole"}], "SeverityLabel": [{"Comparison": "EQUALS", "Value": "HIGH"}]}' \
    --name "High severity role findings"
```

**Example 2: To change the grouping attribute for a custom insight**

The following `update-insight` example changes the grouping attribute for the custom insight with the specified ARN. The new grouping attribute is the resource ID.

```
aws securityhub update-insight \
    --insight-arn "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:insight/123456789012/custom/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111" \
    --group-by-attribute "ResourceId" \
    --name "Critical role findings"
```

Output:

```

                        "Comparison": "EQUALS"
                    }
                ],
                "ResourceType": [
                    {

                    }
                ]
            },
            "GroupByAttribute": "ResourceId"
        }
    ]
}
```
