# resend-confirmation-code

## Description

Resends the code that confirms a new account for a user who has signed up in your user pool. Amazon Cognito sends confirmation codes to the user attribute in the `AutoVerifiedAttributes` property of your user pool. When you prompt new users for the confirmation code, include a âResend codeâ option that generates a call to this API operation.

### Note

Amazon Cognito doesnât evaluate Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you canât use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you canât grant IAM permissions in policies. For more information about authorization models in Amazon Cognito, see [Using the Amazon Cognito user pools API and user pool endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pools-API-operations.html) .

### Note

This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/) . Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In * [sandbox mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) * , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see [SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide* .

## Options

`--client-id` (string)

The ID of the user pool app client where the user signed up.

`--secret-hash` (string)

A keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) calculated using the secret key of a user pool client and username plus the client ID in the message. For more information about `SecretHash` , see [Computing secret hash values](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/signing-up-users-in-your-app.html#cognito-user-pools-computing-secret-hash) .

`--user-context-data` (structure)

Contextual data about your user session like the device fingerprint, IP address, or location. Amazon Cognito threat protection evaluates the risk of an authentication event based on the context that your app generates and passes to Amazon Cognito when it makes API requests.

For more information, see [Collecting data for threat protection in applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-viewing-threat-protection-app.html) .

IpAddress -> (string)

The source IP address of your userâs device.

EncodedData -> (string)

Encoded device-fingerprint details that your app collected with the Amazon Cognito context data collection library. For more information, see [Adding user device and session data to API requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication.html#user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication-device-fingerprint) .

Shorthand Syntax:

```
IpAddress=string,EncodedData=string
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{
  "IpAddress": "string",
  "EncodedData": "string"
}
```

`--username` (string)

The name of the user that you want to query or modify. The value of this parameter is typically your userâs username, but it can be any of their alias attributes. If `username` isnât an alias attribute in your user pool, this value must be the `sub` of a local user or the username of a user from a third-party IdP.

`--analytics-metadata` (structure)

Information that supports analytics outcomes with Amazon Pinpoint, including the userâs endpoint ID. The endpoint ID is a destination for Amazon Pinpoint push notifications, for example a device identifier, email address, or phone number.

AnalyticsEndpointId -> (string)

The endpoint ID. Information that you want to pass to Amazon Pinpoint about where to send notifications.

Shorthand Syntax:

```
AnalyticsEndpointId=string
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{
  "AnalyticsEndpointId": "string"
}
```

`--client-metadata` (map)

A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers.

You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the ResendConfirmationCode API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the *custom message* trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a `clientMetadata` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your ResendConfirmationCode request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the `clientMetadata` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

For more information, see [Using Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide* .

### Note

When you use the `ClientMetadata` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito wonât do the following:

- Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesnât include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.
- Validate the `ClientMetadata` value.
- Encrypt the `ClientMetadata` value. Donât send sensitive information in this parameter.

key -> (string)

value -> (string)

Shorthand Syntax:

```
KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{"string": "string"
  ...}
```

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .
