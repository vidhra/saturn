# update-group

## Description

Given the name of a user pool group, updates any of the properties for precedence, IAM role, or description. For more information about user pool groups, see [Adding groups to a user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-user-groups.html) .

### Note

Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

## Options

`--group-name` (string)

The name of the group that you want to update.

`--user-pool-id` (string)

The ID of the user pool that contains the group you want to update.

`--description` (string)

A new description of the existing group.

`--role-arn` (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that you want to associate with the group. The role assignment contributes to the `cognito:roles` and `cognito:preferred_role` claims in group membersâ tokens.

`--precedence` (integer)

A non-negative integer value that specifies the precedence of this group relative to the other groups that a user can belong to in the user pool. Zero is the highest precedence value. Groups with lower `Precedence` values take precedence over groups with higher or null `Precedence` values. If a user belongs to two or more groups, it is the group with the lowest precedence value whose role ARN is given in the userâs tokens for the `cognito:roles` and `cognito:preferred_role` claims.

Two groups can have the same `Precedence` value. If this happens, neither group takes precedence over the other. If two groups with the same `Precedence` have the same role ARN, that role is used in the `cognito:preferred_role` claim in tokens for users in each group. If the two groups have different role ARNs, the `cognito:preferred_role` claim isnât set in usersâ tokens.

The default `Precedence` value is null. The maximum `Precedence` value is `2^31-1` .

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To update a group**

This example updates the description and precedence for MyGroup.

Command:

```
aws cognito-idp update-group --user-pool-id us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa --group-name MyGroup --description "New description" --precedence 2
```

Output:

```
{
  "Group": {
      "GroupName": "MyGroup",
      "UserPoolId": "us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa",
      "Description": "New description",
      "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/MyRole",
      "Precedence": 2,
      "LastModifiedDate": 1548800862.812,
      "CreationDate": 1548097827.125
  }
}
```

## Output

Group -> (structure)

Contains the updated details of the group, including precedence, IAM role, and description.

GroupName -> (string)

The name of the group.

UserPoolId -> (string)

The ID of the user pool that contains the group.

Description -> (string)

A friendly description of the group.

RoleArn -> (string)

The ARN of the IAM role associated with the group. If a group has the highest priority of a userâs groups, users who authenticate with an identity pool get credentials for the `RoleArn` thatâs associated with the group.

Precedence -> (integer)

A non-negative integer value that specifies the precedence of this group relative to the other groups that a user can belong to in the user pool. Zero is the highest precedence value. Groups with lower `Precedence` values take precedence over groups with higher ornull `Precedence` values. If a user belongs to two or more groups, it is the group with the lowest precedence value whose role ARN is given in the userâs tokens for the `cognito:roles` and `cognito:preferred_role` claims.

Two groups can have the same `Precedence` value. If this happens, neither group takes precedence over the other. If two groups with the same `Precedence` have the same role ARN, that role is used in the `cognito:preferred_role` claim in tokens for users in each group. If the two groups have different role ARNs, the `cognito:preferred_role` claim isnât set in usersâ tokens.

The default `Precedence` value is `null` .

LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)

The date and time when the item was modified. Amazon Cognito returns this timestamp in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK might render the output in a human-readable format like ISO 8601 or a Java `Date` object.

CreationDate -> (timestamp)

The date and time when the item was created. Amazon Cognito returns this timestamp in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK might render the output in a human-readable format like ISO 8601 or a Java `Date` object.
