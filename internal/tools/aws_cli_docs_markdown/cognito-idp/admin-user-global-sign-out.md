# admin-user-global-sign-out

## Description

Invalidates the identity, access, and refresh tokens that Amazon Cognito issued to a user. Call this operation with your administrative credentials when your user signs out of your app. This results in the following behavior.

- Amazon Cognito no longer accepts *token-authorized* user operations that you authorize with a signed-out userâs access tokens. For more information, see [Using the Amazon Cognito user pools API and user pool endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pools-API-operations.html) . Amazon Cognito returns an `Access Token has been revoked` error when your app attempts to authorize a user pools API request with a revoked access token that contains the scope `aws.cognito.signin.user.admin` .
- Amazon Cognito no longer accepts a signed-out userâs ID token in a [GetId](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/API_GetId.html) request to an identity pool with `ServerSideTokenCheck` enabled for its user pool IdP configuration in [CognitoIdentityProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/API_CognitoIdentityProvider.html) .
- Amazon Cognito no longer accepts a signed-out userâs refresh tokens in refresh requests.

Other requests might be valid until your userâs token expires. This operation doesnât clear the [managed login](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-managed-login.html) session cookie. To clear the session for a user who signed in with managed login or the classic hosted UI, direct their browser session to the [logout endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/logout-endpoint.html) .

### Note

Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

## Options

`--user-pool-id` (string)

The ID of the user pool where you want to sign out a user.

`--username` (string)

The name of the user that you want to query or modify. The value of this parameter is typically your userâs username, but it can be any of their alias attributes. If `username` isnât an alias attribute in your user pool, this value must be the `sub` of a local user or the username of a user from a third-party IdP.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To sign out a user as an admin**

The following `admin-user-global-sign-out` example signs out the user [diego@example.com](mailto:diego%40example.com).

```
aws cognito-idp admin-user-global-sign-out \
    --user-pool-id us-west-2_EXAMPLE \
    --username diego@example.com
```

For more information, see [Authentication with a user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.
