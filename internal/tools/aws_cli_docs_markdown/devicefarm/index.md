For more information, see [Testing Web Applications on Selenium with Device Farm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/testgrid/) .
- Testing on real mobile devices Device Farm makes it possible for you to test apps on physical phones, tablets, and other devices in the cloud. For more information, see the [Device Farm Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/) .
