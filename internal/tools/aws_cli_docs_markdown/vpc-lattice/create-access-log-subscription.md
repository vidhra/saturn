# create-access-log-subscription

## Description

Enables access logs to be sent to Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon S3, and Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. The service network owner can use the access logs to audit the services in the network. The service network owner can only see access logs from clients and services that are associated with their service network. Access log entries represent traffic originated from VPCs associated with that network. For more information, see [Access logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/monitoring-access-logs.html) in the *Amazon VPC Lattice User Guide* .

## Options

`--client-token` (string)

A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. If you retry a request that completed successfully using the same client token and parameters, the retry succeeds without performing any actions. If the parameters arenât identical, the retry fails.

`--destination-arn` (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination. The supported destination types are CloudWatch Log groups, Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams, and Amazon S3 buckets.

`--resource-identifier` (string)

The ID or ARN of the service network or service.

`--service-network-log-type` (string)

The type of log that monitors your Amazon VPC Lattice service networks.

Possible values:

- `SERVICE`
- `RESOURCE`

`--tags` (map)

The tags for the access log subscription.

key -> (string)

The key of the tag.

Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 128 Unicode characters. Valid characters are Unicode letters, digits, white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / = + - @ May not begin with `aws:` .

value -> (string)

The value of the tag.

Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 256 Unicode characters. Valid characters are Unicode letters, digits, white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / = + - @

Shorthand Syntax:

```
KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{"string": "string"
  ...}
```

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

arn -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the access log subscription.

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the log destination.

id -> (string)

The ID of the access log subscription.

resourceArn -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service network or service.

resourceId -> (string)

The ID of the service network or service.

The type of log that monitors your Amazon VPC Lattice service networks.
