# amplifyuibuilder

## Description

The Amplify UI Builder API provides a programmatic interface for creating and configuring user interface (UI) component libraries and themes for use in your Amplify applications. You can then connect these UI components to an applicationâs backend Amazon Web Services resources.

You can also use the Amplify Studio visual designer to create UI components and model data for an app. For more information, see [Introduction](https://docs.amplify.aws/console/adminui/intro) in the *Amplify Docs* .

The Amplify Framework is a comprehensive set of SDKs, libraries, tools, and documentation for client app development. For more information, see the [Amplify Framework](https://docs.amplify.aws/) . For more information about deploying an Amplify application to Amazon Web Services, see the [Amplify User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.html) .
