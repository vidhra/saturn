# list-qualification-types

## Description

The `ListQualificationTypes` operation returns a list of Qualification types, filtered by an optional search term.

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/mturk-requester-2017-01-17/ListQualificationTypes)

`list-qualification-types` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the `--no-paginate` argument.
When using `--output text` and the `--query` argument on a paginated response, the `--query` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: `QualificationTypes`

## Options

`--must-be-requestable` | `--no-must-be-requestable` (boolean)

Specifies that only Qualification types that a user can request through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, such as by taking a Qualification test, are returned as results of the search. Some Qualification types, such as those assigned automatically by the system, cannot be requested directly by users. If false, all Qualification types, including those managed by the system, are considered. Valid values are True | False.

`--must-be-owned-by-caller` | `--no-must-be-owned-by-caller` (boolean)

Specifies that only Qualification types that the Requester created are returned. If false, the operation returns all Qualification types.

`--types-query` (string)

A text query against all of the searchable attributes of Qualification types.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--starting-token` (string)

A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the `NextToken` from a previously truncated response.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--page-size` (integer)

The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the commandâs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--max-items` (integer)

The total number of items to return in the commandâs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a `NextToken` is provided in the commandâs output. To resume pagination, provide the `NextToken` value in the `starting-token` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the `NextToken` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

NumResults -> (integer)

The number of Qualification types on this page in the filtered results list, equivalent to the number of types this operation returns.

NextToken -> (string)

If the previous response was incomplete (because there is more data to retrieve), Amazon Mechanical Turk returns a pagination token in the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set of results.

QualificationTypes -> (list)

The list of QualificationType elements returned by the query.

(structure)

The QualificationType data structure represents a Qualification type, a description of a property of a Worker that must match the requirements of a HIT for the Worker to be able to accept the HIT. The type also describes how a Worker can obtain a Qualification of that type, such as through a Qualification test.

QualificationTypeId -> (string)

A unique identifier for the Qualification type. A Qualification type is given a Qualification type ID when you call the CreateQualificationType operation.

CreationTime -> (timestamp)

The date and time the Qualification type was created.

Name -> (string)

The name of the Qualification type. The type name is used to identify the type, and to find the type using a Qualification type search.

Description -> (string)

A long description for the Qualification type.

Keywords -> (string)

One or more words or phrases that describe theQualification type, separated by commas. The Keywords make the type easier to find using a search.

QualificationTypeStatus -> (string)

The status of the Qualification type. A Qualification typeâs status determines if users can apply to receive a Qualification of this type, and if HITs can be created with requirements based on this type. Valid values are Active | Inactive.

Test -> (string)

The questions for a Qualification test associated with this Qualification type that a user can take to obtain a Qualification of this type. This parameter must be specified if AnswerKey is present. A Qualification type cannot have both a specified Test parameter and an AutoGranted value of true.

TestDurationInSeconds -> (long)

The amount of time, in seconds, given to a Worker to complete the Qualification test, beginning from the time the Worker requests the Qualification.

AnswerKey -> (string)

The answers to the Qualification test specified in the Test parameter.

RetryDelayInSeconds -> (long)

The amount of time, in seconds, Workers must wait after taking the Qualification test before they can take it again. Workers can take a Qualification test multiple times if they were not granted the Qualification from a previous attempt, or if the test offers a gradient score and they want a better score. If not specified, retries are disabled and Workers can request a Qualification only once.

IsRequestable -> (boolean)

Specifies whether the Qualification type is one that a user can request through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, such as by taking a Qualification test. This value is False for Qualifications assigned automatically by the system. Valid values are True | False.

AutoGranted -> (boolean)

Specifies that requests for the Qualification type are granted immediately, without prompting the Worker with a Qualification test. Valid values are True | False.

AutoGrantedValue -> (integer)

The Qualification integer value to use for automatically granted Qualifications, if AutoGranted is true. This is 1 by default.
