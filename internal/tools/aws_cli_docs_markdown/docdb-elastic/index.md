## Description

Amazon DocumentDB elastic-clusters support workloads with millions of reads/writes per second and petabytes of storage capacity. Amazon DocumentDB elastic clusters also simplify how developers interact with Amazon DocumentDB elastic-clusters by eliminating the need to choose, manage or upgrade instances.

Amazon DocumentDB elastic-clusters were created to:

- provide a solution for customers looking for a database that provides virtually limitless scale with rich query capabilities and MongoDB API compatibility.
- give customers higher connection limits, and to reduce downtime from patching.
- continue investing in a cloud-native, elastic, and class leading architecture for JSON workloads.
