# list-caller-access-grants

## Description

Use this API to list the access grants that grant the caller access to Amazon S3 data through S3 Access Grants. The caller (grantee) can be an Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity or Amazon Web Services Identity Center corporate directory identity. You must pass the Amazon Web Services account of the S3 data owner (grantor) in the request. You can, optionally, narrow the results by `GrantScope` , using a fragment of the dataâs S3 path, and S3 Access Grants will return only the grants with a path that contains the path fragment. You can also pass the `AllowedByApplication` filter in the request, which returns only the grants authorized for applications, whether the application is the callerâs Identity Center application or any other application (`ALL` ). For more information, see [List the callerâs access grants](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-grants-list-grants.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

Permissions

You must have the `s3:ListCallerAccessGrants` permission to use this operation.

`list-caller-access-grants` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the `--no-paginate` argument.
When using `--output text` and the `--query` argument on a paginated response, the `--query` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: `CallerAccessGrantsList`

## Options

`--account-id` (string)

The Amazon Web Services account ID of the S3 Access Grants instance.

`--grant-scope` (string)

The S3 path of the data that you would like to access. Must start with `s3://` . You can optionally pass only the beginning characters of a path, and S3 Access Grants will search for all applicable grants for the path fragment.

`--allowed-by-application` | `--no-allowed-by-application` (boolean)

If this optional parameter is passed in the request, a filter is applied to the results. The results will include only the access grants for the callerâs Identity Center application or for any other applications (`ALL` ).

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--starting-token` (string)

A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the `NextToken` from a previously truncated response.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--page-size` (integer)

The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the commandâs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--max-items` (integer)

The total number of items to return in the commandâs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a `NextToken` is provided in the commandâs output. To resume pagination, provide the `NextToken` value in the `starting-token` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the `NextToken` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

NextToken -> (string)

A pagination token that you can use to request the next page of results. Pass this value into a subsequent `List Caller Access Grants` request in order to retrieve the next page of results.

CallerAccessGrantsList -> (list)

A list of the callerâs access grants that were created using S3 Access Grants and that grant the caller access to the S3 data of the Amazon Web Services account ID that was specified in the request.

(structure)

Part of `ListCallerAccessGrantsResult` . Each entry includes the permission level (READ, WRITE, or READWRITE) and the grant scope of the access grant. If the grant also includes an application ARN, the grantee can only access the S3 data through this application.

Permission -> (string)

The type of permission granted, which can be one of the following values:

- `READ` - Grants read-only access to the S3 data.
- `WRITE` - Grants write-only access to the S3 data.
- `READWRITE` - Grants both read and write access to the S3 data.

GrantScope -> (string)

The S3 path of the data to which you have been granted access.

ApplicationArn -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Web Services IAM Identity Center application associated with your Identity Center instance. If the grant includes an application ARN, the grantee can only access the S3 data through this application.
