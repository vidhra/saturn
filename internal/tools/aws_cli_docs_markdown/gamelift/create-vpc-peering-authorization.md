# create-vpc-peering-authorization

## Description

Requests authorization to create or delete a peer connection between the VPC for your Amazon GameLift fleet and a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your Amazon Web Services account. VPC peering enables the game servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other Amazon Web Services resources. After youâve received authorization, use [CreateVpcPeeringConnection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateVpcPeeringConnection.html) to establish the peering connection. For more information, see [VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html) .

You can peer with VPCs that are owned by any Amazon Web Services account you have access to, including the account that you use to manage your Amazon GameLift fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are in different Regions.

To request authorization to create a connection, call this operation from the Amazon Web Services account with the VPC that you want to peer to your Amazon GameLift fleet. For example, to enable your game servers to retrieve data from a DynamoDB table, use the account that manages that DynamoDB resource. Identify the following values: (1) The ID of the VPC that you want to peer with, and (2) the ID of the Amazon Web Services account that you use to manage Amazon GameLift. If successful, VPC peering is authorized for the specified VPC.

To request authorization to delete a connection, call this operation from the Amazon Web Services account with the VPC that is peered with your Amazon GameLift fleet. Identify the following values: (1) VPC ID that you want to delete the peering connection for, and (2) ID of the Amazon Web Services account that you use to manage Amazon GameLift.

The authorization remains valid for 24 hours unless it is canceled. You must create or delete the peering connection while the authorization is valid.

## Options

`--game-lift-aws-account-id` (string)

A unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account that you use to manage your Amazon GameLift fleet. You can find your Account ID in the Amazon Web Services Management Console under account settings.

`--peer-vpc-id` (string)

A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by your Amazon GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet. To look up a VPC ID, use the [VPC Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/) in the Amazon Web Services Management Console. Learn more about VPC peering in [VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html) .

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.
