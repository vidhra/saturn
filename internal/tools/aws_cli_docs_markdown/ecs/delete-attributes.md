## Options

`--cluster` (string)

The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that contains the resource to delete attributes. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

`--attributes` (list)

The attributes to delete from your resource. You can specify up to 10 attributes for each request. For custom attributes, specify the attribute name and target ID, but donât specify the value. If you specify the target ID using the short form, you must also specify the target type.

(structure)

An attribute is a name-value pair thatâs associated with an Amazon ECS object. Use attributes to extend the Amazon ECS data model by adding custom metadata to your resources. For more information, see [Attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-placement-constraints.html#attributes) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

name -> (string)

The name of the attribute. The `name` must contain between 1 and 128 characters. The name may contain letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-), underscores (_), forward slashes (/), back slashes (), or periods (.).

value -> (string)

The value of the attribute. The `value` must contain between 1 and 128 characters. It can contain letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-), underscores (_), periods (.), at signs (@), forward slashes (/), back slashes (), colons (:), or spaces. The value canât start or end with a space.

targetType -> (string)

The type of the target to attach the attribute with. This parameter is required if you use the short form ID for a resource instead of the full ARN.

targetId -> (string)

The ID of the target. You can specify the short form ID for a resource or the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

Shorthand Syntax:

```
name=string,value=string,targetType=string,targetId=string ...
```

JSON Syntax:

```
[
  {
    "name": "string",
    "value": "string",
    "targetType": "container-instance",
    "targetId": "string"
  }
  ...
]
```

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To delete one or more custom attributes from an Amazon ECS resource**

The following `delete-attributes` deletes an attribute with the name `stack` from a container instance.

```
aws ecs delete-attributes \
    --attributes name=stack,targetId=arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:130757420319:container-instance/1c3be8ed-df30-47b4-8f1e-6e68ebd01f34
```

Output:

```
{
    "attributes": [
        {
            "name": "stack",
            "targetId": "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:130757420319:container-instance/1c3be8ed-df30-47b4-8f1e-6e68ebd01f34",
            "value": "production"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Output

attributes -> (list)

A list of attribute objects that were successfully deleted from your resource.

An attribute is a name-value pair thatâs associated with an Amazon ECS object. Use attributes to extend the Amazon ECS data model by adding custom metadata to your resources.

It can contain letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-), underscores (_), periods (.), at signs (@), forward slashes (/), back slashes (), colons (:), or spaces. The value canât start or end with a space.

targetType -> (string)

The type of the target to attach the attribute with. This parameter is required if you use the short form ID for a resource instead of the full ARN.

targetId -> (string)

The ID of the target. You can specify the short form ID for a resource or the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
