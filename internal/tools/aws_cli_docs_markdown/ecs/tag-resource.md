# tag-resource

## Description

Associates the specified tags to a resource with the specified `resourceArn` . If existing tags on a resource arenât specified in the request parameters, they arenât changed. When a resource is deleted, the tags that are associated with that resource are deleted as well.

## Options

`--resource-arn` (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource to add tags to. Currently, the supported resources are Amazon ECS capacity providers, tasks, services, task definitions, clusters, and container instances.

In order to tag a service that has the following ARN format, you need to migrate the service to the long ARN. For more information, see [Migrate an Amazon ECS short service ARN to a long ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-arn-migration.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

`arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:service/service-name`

After the migration is complete, the service has the long ARN format, as shown below. Use this ARN to tag the service.

`arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:service/cluster-name/service-name`

If you try to tag a service with a short ARN, you receive an `InvalidParameterException` error.

`--tags` (list)

The tags to add to the resource. A tag is an array of key-value pairs.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

- Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
- For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
- Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
- Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
- If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
- Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
- Do not use `aws:` , `AWS:` , or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

(structure)

The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You define them.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

- Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
- For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
- Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
- Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
- If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
- Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
- Do not use `aws:` , `AWS:` , or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

key -> (string)

One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A `key` is a general label that acts like a category for more specific tag values.

value -> (string)

The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A `value` acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

Shorthand Syntax:

```
key=string,value=string ...
```

JSON Syntax:

```
[
  {
    "key": "string",
    "value": "string"
  }
  ...
]
```

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To tag a resource**

The following `tag-resource` example adds a single tag to the specified resource.

```
aws ecs tag-resource \
    --resource-arn arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster/MyCluster
    --tags key=key1,value=value1
```

This command produces no output.

**To add multiple tags to a resource**

The following `tag-resource` example adds multiple tags to the specified resource.

```
aws ecs tag-resource \
--resource-arn arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster/MyCluster \
--tags key=key1,value=value1 key=key2,value=value2 key=key3,value=value3
```

This command produces no output.
