# create-model

## Description

Creates a model in SageMaker. In the request, you name the model and describe a primary container. For the primary container, you specify the Docker image that contains inference code, artifacts (from prior training), and a custom environment map that the inference code uses when you deploy the model for predictions.

Use this API to create a model if you want to use SageMaker hosting services or run a batch transform job.

To host your model, you create an endpoint configuration with the `CreateEndpointConfig` API, and then create an endpoint with the `CreateEndpoint` API. SageMaker then deploys all of the containers that you defined for the model in the hosting environment.

To run a batch transform using your model, you start a job with the `CreateTransformJob` API. SageMaker uses your model and your dataset to get inferences which are then saved to a specified S3 location.

In the request, you also provide an IAM role that SageMaker can assume to access model artifacts and docker image for deployment on ML compute hosting instances or for batch transform jobs. In addition, you also use the IAM role to manage permissions the inference code needs. For example, if the inference code access any other Amazon Web Services resources, you grant necessary permissions via this role.

## Options

`--model-name` (string)

The name of the new model.

`--primary-container` (structure)

The location of the primary docker image containing inference code, associated artifacts, and custom environment map that the inference code uses when the model is deployed for predictions.

ContainerHostname -> (string)

This parameter is ignored for models that contain only a `PrimaryContainer` .

When a `ContainerDefinition` is part of an inference pipeline, the value of the parameter uniquely identifies the container for the purposes of logging and metrics. For information, see [Use Logs and Metrics to Monitor an Inference Pipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/inference-pipeline-logs-metrics.html) . If you donât specify a value for this parameter for a `ContainerDefinition` that is part of an inference pipeline, a unique name is automatically assigned based on the position of the `ContainerDefinition` in the pipeline. If you specify a value for the `ContainerHostName` for any `ContainerDefinition` that is part of an inference pipeline, you must specify a value for the `ContainerHostName` parameter of every `ContainerDefinition` in that pipeline.

Image -> (string)

The path where inference code is stored. This can be either in Amazon EC2 Container Registry or in a Docker registry that is accessible from the same VPC that you configure for your endpoint. If you are using your own custom algorithm instead of an algorithm provided by SageMaker, the inference code must meet SageMaker requirements. SageMaker supports both `registry/repository[:tag]` and `registry/repository[@digest]` image path formats. For more information, see [Using Your Own Algorithms with Amazon SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms.html) .

### Note

The model artifacts in an Amazon S3 bucket and the Docker image for inference container in Amazon EC2 Container Registry must be in the same region as the model or endpoint you are creating.

ImageConfig -> (structure)

Specifies whether the model container is in Amazon ECR or a private Docker registry accessible from your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). For information about storing containers in a private Docker registry, see [Use a Private Docker Registry for Real-Time Inference Containers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-containers-inference-private.html) .

### Note

The model artifacts in an Amazon S3 bucket and the Docker image for inference container in Amazon EC2 Container Registry must be in the same region as the model or endpoint you are creating.

RepositoryAccessMode -> (string)

Set this to one of the following values:

- `Platform` - The model image is hosted in Amazon ECR.
- `Vpc` - The model image is hosted in a private Docker registry in your VPC.

RepositoryAuthConfig -> (structure)

(Optional) Specifies an authentication configuration for the private docker registry where your model image is hosted. Specify a value for this property only if you specified `Vpc` as the value for the `RepositoryAccessMode` field, and the private Docker registry where the model image is hosted requires authentication.

RepositoryCredentialsProviderArn -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Web Services Lambda function that provides credentials to authenticate to the private Docker registry where your model image is hosted. For information about how to create an Amazon Web Services Lambda function, see [Create a Lambda function with the console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started-create-function.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Lambda Developer Guide* .

Mode -> (string)

Whether the container hosts a single model or multiple models.

ModelDataUrl -> (string)

The S3 path where the model artifacts, which result from model training, are stored. This path must point to a single gzip compressed tar archive (.tar.gz suffix). The S3 path is required for SageMaker built-in algorithms, but not if you use your own algorithms. For more information on built-in algorithms, see [Common Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-algo-docker-registry-paths.html) .

### Note

The model artifacts must be in an S3 bucket that is in the same region as the model or endpoint you are creating.

If you provide a value for this parameter, SageMaker uses Amazon Web Services Security Token Service to download model artifacts from the S3 path you provide. Amazon Web Services STS is activated in your Amazon Web Services account by default. If you previously deactivated Amazon Web Services STS for a region, you need to reactivate Amazon Web Services STS for that region. For more information, see [Activating and Deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an Amazon Web Services Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management User Guide* .

### Warning

If you use a built-in algorithm to create a model, SageMaker requires that you provide a S3 path to the model artifacts in `ModelDataUrl` .

ModelDataSource -> (structure)

Specifies the location of ML model data to deploy.

### Note

Currently you cannot use `ModelDataSource` in conjunction with SageMaker batch transform, SageMaker serverless endpoints, SageMaker multi-model endpoints, and SageMaker Marketplace.

S3DataSource -> (structure)

Specifies the S3 location of ML model data to deploy.

S3Uri -> (string)

Specifies the S3 path of ML model data to deploy.

S3DataType -> (string)

Specifies the type of ML model data to deploy.

If you choose `S3Prefix` , `S3Uri` identifies a key name prefix. SageMaker uses all objects that match the specified key name prefix as part of the ML model data to deploy. A valid key name prefix identified by `S3Uri` always ends with a forward slash (/).

If you choose `S3Object` , `S3Uri` identifies an object that is the ML model data to deploy.

CompressionType -> (string)

Specifies how the ML model data is prepared.

If you choose `Gzip` and choose `S3Object` as the value of `S3DataType` , `S3Uri` identifies an object that is a gzip-compressed TAR archive. SageMaker will attempt to decompress and untar the object during model deployment.

If you choose `None` and chooose `S3Object` as the value of `S3DataType` , `S3Uri` identifies an object that represents an uncompressed ML model to deploy.

If you choose None and choose `S3Prefix` as the value of `S3DataType` , `S3Uri` identifies a key name prefix, under which all objects represents the uncompressed ML model to deploy.

If you choose None, then SageMaker will follow rules below when creating model data files under /opt/ml/model directory for use by your inference code:

- If you choose `S3Object` as the value of `S3DataType` , then SageMaker will split the key of the S3 object referenced by `S3Uri` by slash (/), and use the last part as the filename of the file holding the content of the S3 object.
- If you choose `S3Prefix` as the value of `S3DataType` , then for each S3 object under the key name pefix referenced by `S3Uri` , SageMaker will trim its key by the prefix, and use the remainder as the path (relative to `/opt/ml/model` ) of the file holding the content of the S3 object. SageMaker will split the remainder by slash (/), using intermediate parts as directory names and the last part as filename of the file holding the content of the S3 object.
- Do not use any of the following as file names or directory names:
- An empty or blank string
- A string which contains null bytes
- A string longer than 255 bytes
- A single dot (`.` )
- A double dot (`..` )
- Ambiguous file names will result in model deployment failure. For example, if your uncompressed ML model consists of two S3 objects `s3://mybucket/model/weights` and `s3://mybucket/model/weights/part1` and you specify `s3://mybucket/model/` as the value of `S3Uri` and `S3Prefix` as the value of `S3DataType` , then it will result in name clash between `/opt/ml/model/weights` (a regular file) and `/opt/ml/model/weights/` (a directory).
- Do not organize the model artifacts in [S3 console using folders](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-folders.html) . When you create a folder in S3 console, S3 creates a 0-byte object with a key set to the folder name you provide. They key of the 0-byte object ends with a slash (/) which violates SageMaker restrictions on model artifact file names, leading to model deployment failure.

ModelAccessConfig -> (structure)

Specifies the access configuration file for the ML model. You can explicitly accept the model end-user license agreement (EULA) within the `ModelAccessConfig` . You are responsible for reviewing and complying with any applicable license terms and making sure they are acceptable for your use case before downloading or using a model.

AcceptEula -> (boolean)

Specifies agreement to the model end-user license agreement (EULA). The `AcceptEula` value must be explicitly defined as `True` in order to accept the EULA that this model requires. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with any applicable license terms and making sure they are acceptable for your use case before downloading or using a model.

HubAccessConfig -> (structure)

Configuration information for hub access.

HubContentArn -> (string)

S3Uri -> (string)

Specifies the S3 path of ML model data to deploy.

S3DataType -> (string)

Specifies the type of ML model data to deploy.

If you choose `S3Prefix` , `S3Uri` identifies a key name prefix. SageMaker uses all objects that match the specified key name prefix as part of the ML model data to deploy. A valid key name prefix identified by `S3Uri` always ends with a forward slash (/).

If you choose `S3Object` , `S3Uri` identifies an object that is the ML model data to deploy.

- Do not organize the model artifacts in [S3 console using folders](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-folders.html) . When you create a folder in S3 console, S3 creates a 0-byte object with a key set to the folder name you provide. They key of the 0-byte object ends with a slash (/) which violates SageMaker restrictions on model artifact file names, leading to model deployment failure.

ModelAccessConfig -> (structure)

Specifies the access configuration file for the ML model. You can explicitly accept the model end-user license agreement (EULA) within the `ModelAccessConfig` . You are responsible for reviewing and complying with any applicable license terms and making sure they are acceptable for your use case before downloading or using a model.

AcceptEula -> (boolean)

Specifies agreement to the model end-user license agreement (EULA). The `AcceptEula` value must be explicitly defined as `True` in order to accept the EULA that this model requires. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with any applicable license terms and making sure they are acceptable for your use case before downloading or using a model.

HubAccessConfig -> (structure)

Configuration information for hub access.

HubContentArn -> (string)

Some use cases do not benefit from model caching. For example, if an endpoint hosts a large number of models that are each invoked infrequently, the endpoint might perform better if you disable model caching. To disable model caching, set the value of this parameter to `Disabled` .

Specifies the S3 location of ML model data to deploy.

S3Uri -> (string)

Specifies the S3 path of ML model data to deploy.

S3DataType -> (string)

Specifies the type of ML model data to deploy.

If you choose `S3Prefix` , `S3Uri` identifies a key name prefix. SageMaker uses all objects that match the specified key name prefix as part of the ML model data to deploy. A valid key name prefix identified by `S3Uri` always ends with a forward slash (/).

If you choose `Gzip` and choose `S3Object` as the value of `S3DataType` , `S3Uri` identifies an object that is a gzip-compressed TAR archive. SageMaker will attempt to decompress and untar the object during model deployment.

If you choose `None` and chooose `S3Object` as the value of `S3DataType` , `S3Uri` identifies an object that represents an uncompressed ML model to deploy.

If you choose None and choose `S3Prefix` as the value of `S3DataType` , `S3Uri` identifies a key name prefix, under which all objects represents the uncompressed ML model to deploy.

If you choose None, then SageMaker will follow rules below when creating model data files under /opt/ml/model directory for use by your inference code:

- If you choose `S3Object` as the value of `S3DataType` , then SageMaker will split the key of the S3 object referenced by `S3Uri` by slash (/), and use the last part as the filename of the file holding the content of the S3 object.

- Do not use any of the following as file names or directory names:
- An empty or blank string
- A string which contains null bytes
- A string longer than 255 bytes
- A single dot (`.` )
- A double dot (`..` )
- Ambiguous file names will result in model deployment failure. For example, if your uncompressed ML model consists of two S3 objects `s3://mybucket/model/weights` and `s3://mybucket/model/weights/part1` and you specify `s3://mybucket/model/` as the value of `S3Uri` and `S3Prefix` as the value of `S3DataType` , then it will result in name clash between `/opt/ml/model/weights` (a regular file) and `/opt/ml/model/weights/` (a directory).
- Do not organize the model artifacts in [S3 console using folders](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-folders.html) . When you create a folder in S3 console, S3 creates a 0-byte object with a key set to the folder name you provide. They key of the 0-byte object ends with a slash (/) which violates SageMaker restrictions on model artifact file names, leading to model deployment failure.

- If you choose `S3Prefix` as the value of `S3DataType` , then for each S3 object under the key name pefix referenced by `S3Uri` , SageMaker will trim its key by the prefix, and use the remainder as the path (relative to `/opt/ml/model` ) of the file holding the content of the S3 object. SageMaker will split the remainder by slash (/), using intermediate parts as directory names and the last part as filename of the file holding the content of the S3 object.
- Do not use any of the following as file names or directory names:
- An empty or blank string
- A string which contains null bytes
- A string longer than 255 bytes
- A single dot (`.` )
- A double dot (`..` )
- Ambiguous file names will result in model deployment failure. For example, if your uncompressed ML model consists of two S3 objects `s3://mybucket/model/weights` and `s3://mybucket/model/weights/part1` and you specify `s3://mybucket/model/` as the value of `S3Uri` and `S3Prefix` as the value of `S3DataType` , then it will result in name clash between `/opt/ml/model/weights` (a regular file) and `/opt/ml/model/weights/` (a directory).
- Do not organize the model artifacts in [S3 console using folders](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-folders.html) . When you create a folder in S3 console, S3 creates a 0-byte object with a key set to the folder name you provide. They key of the 0-byte object ends with a slash (/) which violates SageMaker restrictions on model artifact file names, leading to model deployment failure.

ModelAccessConfig -> (structure)

Specifies the access configuration file for the ML model. You can explicitly accept the model end-user license agreement (EULA) within the `ModelAccessConfig` . You are responsible for reviewing and complying with any applicable license terms and making sure they are acceptable for your use case before downloading or using a model.

AcceptEula -> (boolean)

Specifies agreement to the model end-user license agreement (EULA). The `AcceptEula` value must be explicitly defined as `True` in order to accept the EULA that this model requires. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with any applicable license terms and making sure they are acceptable for your use case before downloading or using a model.

HubAccessConfig -> (structure)

Configuration information for hub access.

HubContentArn -> (string)

The ARN of the hub content for which deployment access is allowed.

ManifestS3Uri -> (string)

The Amazon S3 URI of the manifest file. The manifest file is a CSV file that stores the artifact locations.

ETag -> (string)

The ETag associated with S3 URI.

ManifestEtag -> (string)

The ETag associated with Manifest S3 URI.

Environment -> (map)

The environment variables to set in the Docker container. Donât include any sensitive data in your environment variables.

The maximum length of each key and value in the `Environment` map is 1024 bytes. The maximum length of all keys and values in the map, combined, is 32 KB. If you pass multiple containers to a `CreateModel` request, then the maximum length of all of their maps, combined, is also 32 KB.

key -> (string)

value -> (string)

ModelPackageName -> (string)

The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model package to use to create the model.

InferenceSpecificationName -> (string)

The inference specification name in the model package version.

MultiModelConfig -> (structure)

Specifies additional configuration for multi-model endpoints.

ModelCacheSetting -> (string)

Whether to cache models for a multi-model endpoint. By default, multi-model endpoints cache models so that a model does not have to be loaded into memory each time it is invoked. Some use cases do not benefit from model caching. For example, if an endpoint hosts a large number of models that are each invoked infrequently, the endpoint might perform better if you disable model caching. To disable model caching, set the value of this parameter to `Disabled` .

Shorthand Syntax:

```
SecurityGroupIds=string,string,Subnets=string,string
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{
  "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...],
  "Subnets": ["string", ...]
}
```

`--enable-network-isolation` | `--no-enable-network-isolation` (boolean)

Isolates the model container. No inbound or outbound network calls can be made to or from the model container.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

ModelArn -> (string)

The ARN of the model created in SageMaker.
