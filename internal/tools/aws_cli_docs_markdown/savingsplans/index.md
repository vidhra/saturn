# savingsplans

## Description

Savings Plans are a pricing model that offer significant savings on Amazon Web Services usage (for example, on Amazon EC2 instances). You commit to a consistent amount of usage per hour, in the specified currency, for a term of one or three years, and receive a lower price for that usage. For more information, see the [Amazon Web Services Savings Plans User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/) .
