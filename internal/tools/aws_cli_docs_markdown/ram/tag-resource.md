# tag-resource

## Description

Adds the specified tag keys and values to a resource share or managed permission. If you choose a resource share, the tags are attached to only the resource share, not to the resources that are in the resource share.

The tags on a managed permission are the same for all versions of the managed permission.

## Options

`--resource-share-arn` (string)

Specifies the [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) of the resource share that you want to add tags to. You must specify *either* `resourceShareArn` , or `resourceArn` , but not both.

`--tags` (list)

A list of one or more tag key and value pairs. The tag key must be present and not be an empty string. The tag value must be present but can be an empty string.

(structure)

A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you can attach to your resources to help organize and categorize them. You can also use them to help you secure your resources. For more information, see [Controlling access to Amazon Web Services resources using tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html) .

For more information about tags, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide* .

key -> (string)

The key, or name, attached to the tag. Every tag must have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

value -> (string)

The string value attached to the tag. The value can be an empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

Shorthand Syntax:

```
key=string,value=string ...
```

JSON Syntax:

```
[
  {
    "key": "string",
    "value": "string"
  }
  ...
]
```

`--resource-arn` (string)

Specifies the [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) of the managed permission that you want to add tags to. You must specify *either* `resourceArn` , or `resourceShareArn` , but not both.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To add tags to a resource share**

The following `tag-resource` example adds a tag key `project` and associated value `lima` to the specified resource share.

```
aws ram tag-resource \
    --tags key=project,value=lima \
    --resource-share-arn arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7ab63972-b505-7e2a-420d-6f5d3EXAMPLE
```

This command produces no output.

## Output

None
