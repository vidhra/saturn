# list-opportunities

## Description

This request accepts a list of filters that retrieve opportunity subsets as well as sort options. This feature is available to partners from [Partner Central](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/) using the `ListOpportunities` API action.

To synchronize your system with Amazon Web Services, only list the opportunities that were newly created or updated. We recommend you rely on events emitted by the service into your Amazon Web Services accountâs Amazon EventBridge default event bus, you can also use the `ListOpportunities` action.

We recommend the following approach:

- Find the latest `LastModifiedDate` that you stored, and only use the values that came from Amazon Web Services. Donât use values generated by your system.
- When you send a `ListOpportunities` request, submit the date in ISO 8601 format in the `AfterLastModifiedDate` filter.
- Amazon Web Services only returns opportunities created or updated on or after that date and time. Use `NextToken` to iterate over all pages.

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/partnercentral-selling-2022-07-26/ListOpportunities)

`list-opportunities` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the `--no-paginate` argument.
When using `--output text` and the `--query` argument on a paginated response, the `--query` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: `OpportunitySummaries`

## Options

`--catalog` (string)

Specifies the catalog associated with the request. This field takes a string value from a predefined list: `AWS` or `Sandbox` . The catalog determines which environment the opportunities are listed in. Use `AWS` for listing real opportunities in the Amazon Web Services catalog, and `Sandbox` for testing in secure, isolated environments.

`--customer-company-name` (list)

Filters the opportunities based on the customerâs company name. This allows partners to search for opportunities associated with a specific customer by matching the provided company name string.

(string)

Syntax:

```
"string" "string" ...
```

`--identifier` (list)

Filters the opportunities based on the opportunity identifier. This allows partners to retrieve specific opportunities by providing their unique identifiers, ensuring precise results.

(string)

Syntax:

```
"string" "string" ...
```

`--last-modified-date` (structure)

Filters the opportunities based on their last modified date. This filter helps retrieve opportunities that were updated after the specified date, allowing partners to track recent changes or updates.

AfterLastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)

Specifies the date after which the opportunities were modified. Use this filter to retrieve only those opportunities that were modified after a given timestamp.

BeforeLastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)

Specifies the date before which the opportunities were modified. Use this filter to retrieve only those opportunities that were modified before a given timestamp.

Shorthand Syntax:

```
AfterLastModifiedDate=timestamp,BeforeLastModifiedDate=timestamp
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{
  "AfterLastModifiedDate": timestamp,
  "BeforeLastModifiedDate": timestamp
}
```

`--life-cycle-review-status` (list)

Filters the opportunities based on their current lifecycle approval status. Use this filter to retrieve opportunities with statuses such as `Pending Submission` , `In Review` , `Action Required` , or `Approved` .

(string)

Syntax:

```
"string" "string" ...

Where valid values are:
  Pending Submission
  Submitted
  In review
  Approved
  Rejected
  Action Required
```

`--life-cycle-stage` (list)

Filters the opportunities based on their lifecycle stage. This filter allows partners to retrieve opportunities at various stages in the sales cycle, such as `Qualified` , `Technical Validation` , `Business Validation` , or `Closed Won` .

(string)

Syntax:

```
"string" "string" ...

Where valid values are:
  Prospect
  Qualified
  Technical Validation
  Business Validation
  Committed
  Launched
  Closed Lost
```

`--sort` (structure)

An object that specifies how the response is sorted. The default `Sort.SortBy` value is `LastModifiedDate` .

SortBy -> (string)

Field name to sort by.

SortOrder -> (string)

Sort order.

Default: `Descending`

Shorthand Syntax:

```
SortBy=string,SortOrder=string
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{
  "SortBy": "LastModifiedDate"|"Identifier"|"CustomerCompanyName",
  "SortOrder": "ASCENDING"|"DESCENDING"
}
```

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--starting-token` (string)

A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the `NextToken` from a previously truncated response.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--page-size` (integer)

The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the commandâs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--max-items` (integer)

The total number of items to return in the commandâs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a `NextToken` is provided in the commandâs output. To resume pagination, provide the `NextToken` value in the `starting-token` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the `NextToken` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.
