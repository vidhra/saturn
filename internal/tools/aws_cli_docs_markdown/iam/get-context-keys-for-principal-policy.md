# get-context-keys-for-principal-policy

## Description

Gets a list of all of the context keys referenced in all the IAM policies that are attached to the specified IAM entity. The entity can be an IAM user, group, or role. If you specify a user, then the request also includes all of the policies attached to groups that the user is a member of.

You can optionally include a list of one or more additional policies, specified as strings. If you want to include *only* a list of policies by string, use  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy instead.

**Note:** This operation discloses information about the permissions granted to other users. If you do not want users to see other userâs permissions, then consider allowing them to use  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy instead.

Context keys are variables maintained by Amazon Web Services and its services that provide details about the context of an API query request. Context keys can be evaluated by testing against a value in an IAM policy. Use  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy to understand what key names and values you must supply when you call  SimulatePrincipalPolicy .

## Options

`--policy-source-arn` (string)

The ARN of a user, group, or role whose policies contain the context keys that you want listed. If you specify a user, the list includes context keys that are found in all policies that are attached to the user. The list also includes all groups that the user is a member of. If you pick a group or a role, then it includes only those context keys that are found in policies attached to that entity. Note that all parameters are shown in unencoded form here for clarity, but must be URL encoded to be included as a part of a real HTML request.

For more information about ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

`--policy-input-list` (list)

An optional list of additional policies for which you want the list of context keys that are referenced.

The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

- Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (`\u0020` ) through the end of the ASCII character range
- The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through `\u00FF` )
- The special characters tab (`\u0009` ), line feed (`\u000A` ), and carriage return (`\u000D` )

(string)

Syntax:

```
"string" "string" ...
```

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To list the context keys referenced by all policies associated with an IAM principal**

The following `get-context-keys-for-principal-policy` command retrieves all policies that are attached to the user `saanvi` and any groups she is a member of. It then parses each and lists the context keys used by those policies. Use this command to identify which context key values you must supply to successfully use the `simulate-custom-policy` and `simulate-principal-policy` commands. You can also retrieve the list of context keys used by an arbitrary JSON policy by using the `get-context-keys-for-custom-policy` command.

```
aws iam get-context-keys-for-principal-policy \
   --policy-source-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/saanvi
```

Output:

```
{
    "ContextKeyNames": [
        "aws:username",
        "aws:CurrentTime"
    ]
}
```

For more information, see [Using the IAM Policy Simulator (AWS CLI and AWS API)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html#policies-simulator-using-api) in the *AWS IAM User Guide*.

## Output

ContextKeyNames -> (list)

The list of context keys that are referenced in the input policies.
