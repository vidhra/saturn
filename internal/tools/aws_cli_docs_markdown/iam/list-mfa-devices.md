# list-mfa-devices

## Description

Lists the MFA devices for an IAM user. If the request includes a IAM user name, then this operation lists all the MFA devices associated with the specified user. If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request for this operation.

You can paginate the results using the `MaxItems` and `Marker` parameters.

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/iam-2010-05-08/ListMFADevices)

`list-mfa-devices` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the `--no-paginate` argument.
When using `--output text` and the `--query` argument on a paginated response, the `--query` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: `MFADevices`

## Options

`--user-name` (string)

The name of the user whose MFA devices you want to list.

This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

`--max-items` (integer)

The total number of items to return in the commandâs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a `NextToken` is provided in the commandâs output. To resume pagination, provide the `NextToken` value in the `starting-token` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the `NextToken` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--starting-token` (string)

A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the `NextToken` from a previously truncated response.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--page-size` (integer)

The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the commandâs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To list all MFA devices for a specified user**

This example returns details about the MFA device assigned to the IAM user `Bob`.

```
aws iam list-mfa-devices \
    --user-name Bob
```

Output:

```
{
    "MFADevices": [
        {
            "UserName": "Bob",
            "SerialNumber": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/Bob",
            "EnableDate": "2019-10-28T20:37:09+00:00"
        },
        {
            "UserName": "Bob",
            "SerialNumber": "GAKT12345678",
            "EnableDate": "2023-02-18T21:44:42+00:00"
        },
        {
            "UserName": "Bob",
            "SerialNumber": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:u2f/user/Bob/fidosecuritykey1-7XNL7NFNLZ123456789EXAMPLE",
            "EnableDate": "2023-09-19T02:25:35+00:00"
        },
        {
            "UserName": "Bob",
            "SerialNumber": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:u2f/user/Bob/fidosecuritykey2-VDRQTDBBN5123456789EXAMPLE",
            "EnableDate": "2023-09-19T01:49:18+00:00"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Output

MFADevices -> (list)

A list of MFA devices.

(structure)

Contains information about an MFA device.

This data type is used as a response element in the  ListMFADevices operation.

UserName -> (string)

The user with whom the MFA device is associated.

SerialNumber -> (string)

The serial number that uniquely identifies the MFA device. For virtual MFA devices, the serial number is the device ARN.

EnableDate -> (timestamp)

The date when the MFA device was enabled for the user.

IsTruncated -> (boolean)

A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the `Marker` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the `MaxItems` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check `IsTruncated` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

Marker -> (string)

When `IsTruncated` is `true` , this element is present and contains the value to use for the `Marker` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
