# get-organizations-access-report

## Description

Retrieves the service last accessed data report for Organizations that was previously generated using the ``  GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport `` operation. This operation retrieves the status of your report job and the report contents.

Depending on the parameters that you passed when you generated the report, the data returned could include different information. For details, see  GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport .

To call this operation, you must be signed in to the management account in your organization. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root. You must have permissions to perform this operation. For more information, see [Refining permissions using service last accessed data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html) in the *IAM User Guide* .

For each service that principals in an account (root user, IAM users, or IAM roles) could access using SCPs, the operation returns details about the most recent access attempt. If there was no attempt, the service is listed without details about the most recent attempt to access the service. If the operation fails, it returns the reason that it failed.

By default, the list is sorted by service namespace.

## Options

`--job-id` (string)

The identifier of the request generated by the  GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport operation.

`--max-items` (integer)

Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the `IsTruncated` response element is `true` .

If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the `IsTruncated` response element returns `true` , and `Marker` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

`--marker` (string)

Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the `Marker` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

`--sort-key` (string)

The key that is used to sort the results. If you choose the namespace key, the results are returned in alphabetical order. If you choose the time key, the results are sorted numerically by the date and time.

Possible values:

- `SERVICE_NAMESPACE_ASCENDING`
- `SERVICE_NAMESPACE_DESCENDING`
- `LAST_AUTHENTICATED_TIME_ASCENDING`
- `LAST_AUTHENTICATED_TIME_DESCENDING`

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To retrieve an access report**

The following `get-organizations-access-report` example displays a previously generated access report for an AWS Organizations entity. To generate a report, use the `generate-organizations-access-report` command.

```
aws iam get-organizations-access-report \
    --job-id a8b6c06f-aaa4-8xmp-28bc-81da71836359
```

Output:

```
{
    "JobStatus": "COMPLETED",
    "JobCreationDate": "2019-09-30T06:53:36.187Z",
    "JobCompletionDate": "2019-09-30T06:53:37.547Z",
    "NumberOfServicesAccessible": 188,
    "NumberOfServicesNotAccessed": 171,
    "AccessDetails": [
        {
            "ServiceName": "Alexa for Business",
            "ServiceNamespace": "a4b",
            "TotalAuthenticatedEntities": 0
        },
        ...
}
```

For more information, see [Refining permissions in AWS using last accessed information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html) in the *AWS IAM User Guide*.

## Output

JobStatus -> (string)

The status of the job.

JobCreationDate -> (timestamp)

The date and time, in [ISO 8601 date-time format](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601) , when the report job was created.

JobCompletionDate -> (timestamp)

The date and time, in [ISO 8601 date-time format](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601) , when the generated report job was completed or failed.

This field is null if the job is still in progress, as indicated by a job status value of `IN_PROGRESS` .

NumberOfServicesAccessible -> (integer)

The number of services that the applicable SCPs allow account principals to access.

NumberOfServicesNotAccessed -> (integer)

The number of services that account principals are allowed but did not attempt to access.

AccessDetails -> (list)

An object that contains details about the most recent attempt to access the service.

(structure)

An object that contains details about when a principal in the reported Organizations entity last attempted to access an Amazon Web Services service. A principal can be an IAM user, an IAM role, or the Amazon Web Services account root user within the reported Organizations entity.

This data type is a response element in the  GetOrganizationsAccessReport operation.

ServiceName -> (string)

The name of the service in which access was attempted.

ServiceNamespace -> (string)

The namespace of the service in which access was attempted.

To learn the service namespace of a service, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Web Services services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html) in the *Service Authorization Reference* . Choose the name of the service to view details for that service. In the first paragraph, find the service prefix. For example, `(service prefix: a4b)` . For more information about service namespaces, see [Amazon Web Services service namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#genref-aws-service-namespaces) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

Region -> (string)

The Region where the last service access attempt occurred.

This field is null if no principals in the reported Organizations entity attempted to access the service within the [tracking period](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period) .

EntityPath -> (string)

The path of the Organizations entity (root, organizational unit, or account) from which an authenticated principal last attempted to access the service. Amazon Web Services does not report unauthenticated requests.

This field is null if no principals (IAM users, IAM roles, or root user) in the reported Organizations entity attempted to access the service within the [tracking period](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period) .

LastAuthenticatedTime -> (timestamp)

The date and time, in [ISO 8601 date-time format](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601) , when an authenticated principal most recently attempted to access the service. Amazon Web Services does not report unauthenticated requests.

This field is null if no principals in the reported Organizations entity attempted to access the service within the [tracking period](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period) .

TotalAuthenticatedEntities -> (integer)

The number of accounts with authenticated principals (root user, IAM users, and IAM roles) that attempted to access the service in the tracking period.

IsTruncated -> (boolean)

A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the `Marker` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the `MaxItems` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check `IsTruncated` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

Marker -> (string)

When `IsTruncated` is `true` , this element is present and contains the value to use for the `Marker` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

ErrorDetails -> (structure)

Contains information about the reason that the operation failed.

This data type is used as a response element in the  GetOrganizationsAccessReport ,  GetServiceLastAccessedDetails , and  GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities operations.

Message -> (string)

Detailed information about the reason that the operation failed.

Code -> (string)

The error code associated with the operation failure.
