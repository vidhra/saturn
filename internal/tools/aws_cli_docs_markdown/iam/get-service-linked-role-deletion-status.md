# get-service-linked-role-deletion-status

## Description

Retrieves the status of your service-linked role deletion. After you use  DeleteServiceLinkedRole to submit a service-linked role for deletion, you can use the `DeletionTaskId` parameter in `GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus` to check the status of the deletion. If the deletion fails, this operation returns the reason that it failed, if that information is returned by the service.

[--no-cli-auto-prompt]
```

## Options

`--deletion-task-id` (string)

The deletion task identifier. This identifier is returned by the  DeleteServiceLinkedRole operation in the format `task/aws-service-role/<service-principal-name>/<role-name>/<task-uuid>` .

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To check the status of a request to delete a service-linked role**

The following `get-service-linked-role-deletion-status` example displays the status of a previously request to delete a service-linked role. The delete operation occurs asynchronously. When you make the request, you get a `DeletionTaskId` value that you provide as a parameter for this command.

```
aws iam get-service-linked-role-deletion-status \
    --deletion-task-id task/aws-service-role/lex.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForLexBots/1a2b3c4d-1234-abcd-7890-abcdeEXAMPLE
```

Output:

```
{
"Status": "SUCCEEDED"
}
```

For more information, see [Using service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *AWS IAM User Guide*.

## Output

The status of the deletion.

Reason -> (structure)

An object that contains details about the reason the deletion failed.

Reason -> (string)

A short description of the reason that the service-linked role deletion failed.

RoleUsageList -> (list)

A list of objects that contains details about the service-linked role deletion failure, if that information is returned by the service. If the service-linked role has active sessions or if any resources that were used by the role have not been deleted from the linked service, the role canât be deleted. This parameter includes a list of the resources that are associated with the role and the Region in which the resources are being used.

(structure)

An object that contains details about how a service-linked role is used, if that information is returned by the service.

This data type is used as a response element in the  GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus operation.

Region -> (string)

The name of the Region where the service-linked role is being used.

Resources -> (list)

The name of the resource that is using the service-linked role.

(string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are unique identifiers for Amazon Web Services resources.

For more information about ARNs, go to [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .
