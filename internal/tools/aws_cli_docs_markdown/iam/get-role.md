# get-role

## Description

Retrieves information about the specified role, including the roleâs path, GUID, ARN, and the roleâs trust policy that grants permission to assume the role. For more information about roles, see [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) in the *IAM User Guide* .

### Note

Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the `decode` method of the `java.net.URLDecoder` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

## Options

`--role-name` (string)

The name of the IAM role to get information about.

This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To get information about an IAM role**

The following `get-role` command gets information about the role named `Test-Role`.

```
aws iam get-role \
    --role-name Test-Role
```

Output:

```
{
    "Role": {
        "Description": "Test Role",
        "AssumeRolePolicyDocument":"<URL-encoded-JSON>",
        "MaxSessionDuration": 3600,
        "RoleId": "AROA1234567890EXAMPLE",
        "CreateDate": "2019-11-13T16:45:56Z",
        "RoleName": "Test-Role",
        "Path": "/",
        "RoleLastUsed": {
            "Region": "us-east-1",
            "LastUsedDate": "2019-11-13T17:14:00Z"
        },
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/Test-Role"
    }
}
```

The command displays the trust policy attached to the role. To list the permissions policies attached to a role, use the `list-role-policies` command.

For more information, see [Creating IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create.html) in the *AWS IAM User Guide*.

Description -> (string)

A description of the role that you provide.

MaxSessionDuration -> (integer)

The maximum session duration (in seconds) for the specified role. Anyone who uses the CLI, or API to assume the role can specify the duration using the optional `DurationSeconds` API parameter or `duration-seconds` CLI parameter.

PermissionsBoundary -> (structure)

The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the role.

For more information about permissions boundaries, see [Permissions boundaries for IAM identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) in the *IAM User Guide* .

PermissionsBoundaryType -> (string)

The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of `Policy` .

PermissionsBoundaryArn -> (string)

The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.

Tags -> (list)

A list of tags that are attached to the role. For more information about tagging, see [Tagging IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide* .

(structure)

A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see [Tagging IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide* .

Key -> (string)

The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, `Department` or `Cost Center` are common choices.
