# get-log-group-fields

## Description

Returns a list of the fields that are included in log events in the specified log group. Includes the percentage of log events that contain each field. The search is limited to a time period that you specify.

You can specify the log group to search by using either `logGroupIdentifier` or `logGroupName` . You must specify one of these parameters, but you canât specify both.

In the results, fields that start with `@` are fields generated by CloudWatch Logs. For example, `@timestamp` is the timestamp of each log event. For more information about the fields that are generated by CloudWatch logs, see [Supported Logs and Discovered Fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_AnalyzeLogData-discoverable-fields.html) .

The response results are sorted by the frequency percentage, starting with the highest percentage.

If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use this operation in a monitoring account and view data from the linked source accounts. For more information, see [CloudWatch cross-account observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account.html) .

## Options

`--log-group-name` (string)

The name of the log group to search.

### Note

You must include either `logGroupIdentifier` or `logGroupName` , but not both.

`--time` (long)

The time to set as the center of the query. If you specify `time` , the 8 minutes before and 8 minutes after this time are searched. If you omit `time` , the most recent 15 minutes up to the current time are searched.

The `time` value is specified as epoch time, which is the number of seconds since `January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC` .

`--log-group-identifier` (string)

Specify either the name or ARN of the log group to view. If the log group is in a source account and you are using a monitoring account, you must specify the ARN.

### Note

You must include either `logGroupIdentifier` or `logGroupName` , but not both.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

logGroupFields -> (list)

The array of fields found in the query. Each object in the array contains the name of the field, along with the percentage of time it appeared in the log events that were queried.

(structure)

The fields contained in log events found by a `GetLogGroupFields` operation, along with the percentage of queried log events in which each field appears.

name -> (string)

The name of a log field.

percent -> (integer)

The percentage of log events queried that contained the field.
