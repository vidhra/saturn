# describe-metric-filters

## Description

Lists the specified metric filters. You can list all of the metric filters or filter the results by log name, prefix, metric name, or metric namespace. The results are ASCII-sorted by filter name.

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/logs-2014-03-28/DescribeMetricFilters)

`describe-metric-filters` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the `--no-paginate` argument.
When using `--output text` and the `--query` argument on a paginated response, the `--query` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: `metricFilters`

## Options

`--log-group-name` (string)

The name of the log group.

`--filter-name-prefix` (string)

The prefix to match. CloudWatch Logs uses the value that you set here only if you also include the `logGroupName` parameter in your request.

`--metric-name` (string)

Filters results to include only those with the specified metric name. If you include this parameter in your request, you must also include the `metricNamespace` parameter.

`--metric-namespace` (string)

Filters results to include only those in the specified namespace. If you include this parameter in your request, you must also include the `metricName` parameter.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--starting-token` (string)

A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the `NextToken` from a previously truncated response.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--page-size` (integer)

The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the commandâs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--max-items` (integer)

The total number of items to return in the commandâs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a `NextToken` is provided in the commandâs output. To resume pagination, provide the `NextToken` value in the `starting-token` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the `NextToken` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

metricFilters -> (list)

The metric filters.

(structure)

Metric filters express how CloudWatch Logs would extract metric observations from ingested log events and transform them into metric data in a CloudWatch metric.

filterName -> (string)

The name of the metric filter.

filterPattern -> (string)

A symbolic description of how CloudWatch Logs should interpret the data in each log event. For example, a log event can contain timestamps, IP addresses, strings, and so on. You use the filter pattern to specify what to look for in the log event message.

metricTransformations -> (list)

The metric transformations.

(structure)

Indicates how to transform ingested log events to metric data in a CloudWatch metric.

metricName -> (string)

The name of the CloudWatch metric.

metricNamespace -> (string)

A custom namespace to contain your metric in CloudWatch. Use namespaces to group together metrics that are similar. For more information, see [Namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Namespace) .

metricValue -> (string)

The value to publish to the CloudWatch metric when a filter pattern matches a log event.

defaultValue -> (double)

(Optional) The value to emit when a filter pattern does not match a log event. This value can be null.

dimensions -> (map)

The fields to use as dimensions for the metric. One metric filter can include as many as three dimensions.

### Warning

Metrics extracted from log events are charged as custom metrics. To prevent unexpected high charges, do not specify high-cardinality fields such as `IPAddress` or `requestID` as dimensions. Each different value found for a dimension is treated as a separate metric and accrues charges as a separate custom metric.

CloudWatch Logs disables a metric filter if it generates 1000 different name/value pairs for your specified dimensions within a certain amount of time. This helps to prevent accidental high charges.

You can also set up a billing alarm to alert you if your charges are higher than expected. For more information, see [Creating a Billing Alarm to Monitor Your Estimated Amazon Web Services Charges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html) .

key -> (string)

value -> (string)

unit -> (string)

The unit to assign to the metric. If you omit this, the unit is set as `None` .

creationTime -> (long)

The creation time of the metric filter, expressed as the number of milliseconds after `Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC` .

logGroupName -> (string)

The name of the log group.

applyOnTransformedLogs -> (boolean)

This parameter is valid only for log groups that have an active log transformer. For more information about log transformers, see [PutTransformer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutTransformer.html) .

If this value is `true` , the metric filter is applied on the transformed version of the log events instead of the original ingested log events.

nextToken -> (string)

The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires after 24 hours.
