# put-data-protection-policy

## Description

Creates a data protection policy for the specified log group. A data protection policy can help safeguard sensitive data thatâs ingested by the log group by auditing and masking the sensitive log data.

### Warning

Sensitive data is detected and masked when it is ingested into the log group. When you set a data protection policy, log events ingested into the log group before that time are not masked.

By default, when a user views a log event that includes masked data, the sensitive data is replaced by asterisks. A user who has the `logs:Unmask` permission can use a [GetLogEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_GetLogEvents.html) or [FilterLogEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_FilterLogEvents.html) operation with the `unmask` parameter set to `true` to view the unmasked log events. Users with the `logs:Unmask` can also view unmasked data in the CloudWatch Logs console by running a CloudWatch Logs Insights query with the `unmask` query command.

For more information, including a list of types of data that can be audited and masked, see [Protect sensitive log data with masking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/mask-sensitive-log-data.html) .

The `PutDataProtectionPolicy` operation applies to only the specified log group. You can also use [PutAccountPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutAccountPolicy.html) to create an account-level data protection policy that applies to all log groups in the account, including both existing log groups and log groups that are created level. If a log group has its own data protection policy and the account also has an account-level data protection policy, then the two policies are cumulative. Any sensitive term specified in either policy is masked.

## Options

`--log-group-identifier` (string)

Specify either the log group name or log group ARN.

`--policy-document` (string)

Specify the data protection policy, in JSON.

This policy must include two JSON blocks:

- The first block must include both a `DataIdentifer` array and an `Operation` property with an `Audit` action. The `DataIdentifer` array lists the types of sensitive data that you want to mask. For more information about the available options, see [Types of data that you can mask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/mask-sensitive-log-data-types.html) . The `Operation` property with an `Audit` action is required to find the sensitive data terms. This `Audit` action must contain a `FindingsDestination` object. You can optionally use that `FindingsDestination` object to list one or more destinations to send audit findings to. If you specify destinations such as log groups, Firehose streams, and S3 buckets, they must already exist.
- The second block must include both a `DataIdentifer` array and an `Operation` property with an `Deidentify` action. The `DataIdentifer` array must exactly match the `DataIdentifer` array in the first block of the policy. The `Operation` property with the `Deidentify` action is what actually masks the data, and it must contain the `"MaskConfig": {}` object. The `"MaskConfig": {}` object must be empty.

For an example data protection policy, see the **Examples** section on this page.

### Warning

The contents of the two `DataIdentifer` arrays must match exactly.

In addition to the two JSON blocks, the `policyDocument` can also include `Name` , `Description` , and `Version` fields. The `Name` is used as a dimension when CloudWatch Logs reports audit findings metrics to CloudWatch.

The JSON specified in `policyDocument` can be up to 30,720 characters.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

logGroupIdentifier -> (string)

The log group name or ARN that you specified in your request.

policyDocument -> (string)

The data protection policy used for this log group.

lastUpdatedTime -> (long)

The date and time that this policy was most recently updated.
