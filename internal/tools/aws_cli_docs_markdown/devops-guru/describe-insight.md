# describe-insight

## Description

Returns details about an insight that you specify using its ID.

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/devops-guru-2020-12-01/DescribeInsight)

## Synopsis

```

--id <value>
[--account-id <value>]

[--no-cli-pager]
[--cli-auto-prompt]
[--no-cli-auto-prompt]
```

## Options

`--id` (string)

The ID of the insight.

`--account-id` (string)

The ID of the member account in the organization.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

ProactiveInsight -> (structure)

A `ProactiveInsight` object that represents the requested insight.

Id -> (string)

The ID of the proactive insight.

Name -> (string)

The name of the proactive insight.

Severity -> (string)

The severity of the insight. For more information, see [Understanding insight severities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/working-with-insights.html#understanding-insights-severities) in the *Amazon DevOps Guru User Guide* .

Status -> (string)

The status of the proactive insight.

InsightTimeRange -> (structure)

A time ranged that specifies when the observed behavior in an insight started and ended.

StartTime -> (timestamp)

The time when the behavior described in an insight started.

EndTime -> (timestamp)

The time when the behavior described in an insight ended.

PredictionTimeRange -> (structure)

The time range during which anomalous behavior in a proactive anomaly or an insight is expected to occur.

StartTime -> (timestamp)

The time range during which a metric limit is expected to be exceeded. This applies to proactive insights only.

EndTime -> (timestamp)

The time when the behavior in a proactive insight is expected to end.

ResourceCollection -> (structure)

A collection of Amazon Web Services resources supported by DevOps Guru. The two types of Amazon Web Services resource collections supported are Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks and Amazon Web Services resources that contain the same Amazon Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can be configured to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources that are defined in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag *key* . You can specify up to 500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

CloudFormation -> (structure)

An array of the names of Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks. The stacks define Amazon Web Services resources that DevOps Guru analyzes. You can specify up to 500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

StackNames -> (list)

An array of CloudFormation stack names.

(string)

Tags -> (list)

The Amazon Web Services tags that are used by resources in the resource collection.

Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you can assign the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an Lambda function. For more information about using tags, see the [Tagging best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html) whitepaper.

Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

- A tag *key* (for example, `CostCenter` , `Environment` , `Project` , or `Secret` ). Tag *keys* are case-sensitive.
- An optional field known as a tag *value* (for example, `111122223333` , `Production` , or a team name). Omitting the tag *value* is the same as using an empty string. Like tag *keys* , tag *values* are case-sensitive.

Together these are known as *key* -*value* pairs.

### Warning

The string used for a *key* in a tag that you use to define your resource coverage must begin with the prefix `Devops-guru-` . The tag *key* might be `DevOps-Guru-deployment-application` or `devops-guru-rds-application` . When you create a *key* , the case of characters in the *key* can be whatever you choose. After you create a *key* , it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works with a *key* named `devops-guru-rds` and a *key* named `DevOps-Guru-RDS` , and these act as two different *keys* . Possible *key* /*value* pairs in your application might be `Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS` or `Devops-Guru-production-application/containers` .
