# apigatewaymanagementapi

## Description

The Amazon API Gateway Management API allows you to directly manage runtime aspects of your deployed APIs. To use it, you must explicitly set the SDKâs endpoint to point to the endpoint of your deployed API. The endpoint will be of the form [https:/](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/)/{api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage}, or will be the endpoint corresponding to your APIâs custom domain and base path, if applicable.
