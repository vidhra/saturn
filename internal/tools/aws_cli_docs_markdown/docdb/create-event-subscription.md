# create-event-subscription

## Description

Creates an Amazon DocumentDB event notification subscription. This action requires a topic Amazon Resource Name (ARN) created by using the Amazon DocumentDB console, the Amazon SNS console, or the Amazon SNS API. To obtain an ARN with Amazon SNS, you must create a topic in Amazon SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is displayed in the Amazon SNS console.

You can specify the type of source (`SourceType` ) that you want to be notified of. You can also provide a list of Amazon DocumentDB sources (`SourceIds` ) that trigger the events, and you can provide a list of event categories (`EventCategories` ) for events that you want to be notified of. For example, you can specify `SourceType = db-instance` , `SourceIds = mydbinstance1, mydbinstance2` and `EventCategories = Availability, Backup` .

If you specify both the `SourceType` and `SourceIds` (such as `SourceType = db-instance` and `SourceIdentifier = myDBInstance1` ), you are notified of all the `db-instance` events for the specified source. If you specify a `SourceType` but do not specify a `SourceIdentifier` , you receive notice of the events for that source type for all your Amazon DocumentDB sources. If you do not specify either the `SourceType` or the `SourceIdentifier` , you are notified of events generated from all Amazon DocumentDB sources belonging to your customer account.

## Options

`--subscription-name` (string)

The name of the subscription.

Constraints: The name must be fewer than 255 characters.

`--sns-topic-arn` (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS topic created for event notification. Amazon SNS creates the ARN when you create a topic and subscribe to it.

`--source-type` (string)

The type of source that is generating the events. For example, if you want to be notified of events generated by an instance, you would set this parameter to `db-instance` . If this value is not specified, all events are returned.

Valid values: `db-instance` , `db-cluster` , `db-parameter-group` , `db-security-group` , `db-cluster-snapshot`

`--event-categories` (list)

A list of event categories for a `SourceType` that you want to subscribe to.

(string)

Syntax:

```
"string" "string" ...
```

`--source-ids` (list)

The list of identifiers of the event sources for which events are returned. If not specified, then all sources are included in the response. An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it canât end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

Constraints:

- If `SourceIds` are provided, `SourceType` must also be provided.
- If the source type is an instance, a `DBInstanceIdentifier` must be provided.
- If the source type is a security group, a `DBSecurityGroupName` must be provided.
- If the source type is a parameter group, a `DBParameterGroupName` must be provided.
- If the source type is a snapshot, a `DBSnapshotIdentifier` must be provided.

(string)

Syntax:

```
"string" "string" ...
```

`--enabled` | `--no-enabled` (boolean)

A Boolean value; set to `true` to activate the subscription, set to `false` to create the subscription but not active it.

`--tags` (list)

The tags to be assigned to the event subscription.

(structure)

Metadata assigned to an Amazon DocumentDB resource consisting of a key-value pair.

Key -> (string)

The required name of the tag. The string value can be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length and canât be prefixed with â`aws:` â or â`rds:` â. The string can contain only the set of Unicode letters, digits, white space, â_â, â.â, â/â, â=â, â+â, â-â (Java regex: â^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$â).

Value -> (string)

The optional value of the tag. The string value can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length and canât be prefixed with â`aws:` â or â`rds:` â. The string can contain only the set of Unicode letters, digits, white space, â_â, â.â, â/â, â=â, â+â, â-â (Java regex: â^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$â).

Shorthand Syntax:

```
Key=string,Value=string ...
```

JSON Syntax:

```
[
  {
    "Key": "string",
    "Value": "string"
  }
  ...
]
```

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.
