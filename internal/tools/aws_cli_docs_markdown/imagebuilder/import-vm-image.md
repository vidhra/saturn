# import-vm-image

## Description

When you export your virtual machine (VM) from its virtualization environment, that process creates a set of one or more disk container files that act as snapshots of your VMâs environment, settings, and data. The Amazon EC2 API [ImportImage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ImportImage.html) action uses those files to import your VM and create an AMI. To import using the CLI command, see [import-image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/import-image.html)

You can reference the task ID from the VM import to pull in the AMI that the import created as the base image for your Image Builder recipe.

## Options

`--name` (string)

The name of the base image that is created by the import process.

`--semantic-version` (string)

The semantic version to attach to the base image that was created during the import process. This version follows the semantic version syntax.

### Note

The semantic version has four nodes: <major>.<minor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first three, and can filter on all of them.

**Assignment:** For the first three nodes you can assign any positive integer value, including zero, with an upper limit of 2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder automatically assigns the build number to the fourth node.

**Patterns:** You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the assignment requirements for the nodes that you can assign. For example, you might choose a software version pattern, such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as 2021.01.01.

`--description` (string)

The description for the base image that is created by the import process.

`--platform` (string)

The operating system platform for the imported VM.

Possible values:

- `Windows`
- `Linux`
- `macOS`

`--os-version` (string)

The operating system version for the imported VM.

`--vm-import-task-id` (string)

The `importTaskId` (API) or `ImportTaskId` (CLI) from the Amazon EC2 VM import process. Image Builder retrieves information from the import process to pull in the AMI that is created from the VM source as the base image for your recipe.

`--tags` (map)

Tags that are attached to the import resources.

key -> (string)

value -> (string)

Shorthand Syntax:

```
KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{"string": "string"
  ...}
```

`--client-token` (string)

Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure idempotency of the request. For more information, see [Ensuring idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html) in the *Amazon EC2 API Reference* .

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

requestId -> (string)

The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

imageArn -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AMI that was created during the VM import process. This AMI is used as the base image for the recipe that imported the VM.

clientToken -> (string)

The client token that uniquely identifies the request.
