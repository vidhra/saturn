## Options

`--name` (string)

The name of the workflow to create.

`--semantic-version` (string)

The semantic version of this workflow resource. The semantic version syntax adheres to the following rules.

### Note

The semantic version has four nodes: <major>.<minor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first three, and can filter on all of them.

**Assignment:** For the first three nodes you can assign any positive integer value, including zero, with an upper limit of 2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder automatically assigns the build number to the fourth node.

**Patterns:** You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the assignment requirements for the nodes that you can assign. For example, you might choose a software version pattern, such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as 2021.01.01.

`--description` (string)

Describes the workflow.

`--change-description` (string)

Describes what change has been made in this version of the workflow, or what makes this version different from other versions of the workflow.

`--data` (string)

Contains the UTF-8 encoded YAML document content for the workflow. Alternatively, you can specify the `uri` of a YAML document file stored in Amazon S3. However, you cannot specify both properties.

`--uri` (string)

The `uri` of a YAML component document file. This must be an S3 URL (`s3://bucket/key` ), and the requester must have permission to access the S3 bucket it points to. If you use Amazon S3, you can specify component content up to your service quota.

Alternatively, you can specify the YAML document inline, using the component `data` property. You cannot specify both properties.

`--kms-key-id` (string)

The ID of the KMS key that is used to encrypt this workflow resource.

`--tags` (map)

Tags that apply to the workflow resource.

key -> (string)

value -> (string)

Shorthand Syntax:

```
KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{"string": "string"
  ...}
```

`--client-token` (string)

Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure idempotency of the request. For more information, see [Ensuring idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html) in the *Amazon EC2 API Reference* .

`--type` (string)

The phase in the image build process for which the workflow resource is responsible.

Possible values:

- `BUILD`
- `TEST`
- `DISTRIBUTION`

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

clientToken -> (string)

The client token that uniquely identifies the request.

workflowBuildVersionArn -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the workflow resource that the request created.
