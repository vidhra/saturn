# put-webhook

## Description

Defines a webhook and returns a unique webhook URL generated by CodePipeline. This URL can be supplied to third party source hosting providers to call every time thereâs a code change. When CodePipeline receives a POST request on this URL, the pipeline defined in the webhook is started as long as the POST request satisfied the authentication and filtering requirements supplied when defining the webhook. RegisterWebhookWithThirdParty and DeregisterWebhookWithThirdParty APIs can be used to automatically configure supported third parties to call the generated webhook URL.

### Warning

When creating CodePipeline webhooks, do not use your own credentials or reuse the same secret token across multiple webhooks. For optimal security, generate a unique secret token for each webhook you create. The secret token is an arbitrary string that you provide, which GitHub uses to compute and sign the webhook payloads sent to CodePipeline, for protecting the integrity and authenticity of the webhook payloads. Using your own credentials or reusing the same token across multiple webhooks can lead to security vulnerabilities.

### Note

If a secret token was provided, it will be redacted in the response.

## Options

`--webhook` (structure)

The detail provided in an input file to create the webhook, such as the webhook name, the pipeline name, and the action name. Give the webhook a unique name that helps you identify it. You might name the webhook after the pipeline and action it targets so that you can easily recognize what itâs used for later.

name -> (string)

The name of the webhook.

targetPipeline -> (string)

The name of the pipeline you want to connect to the webhook.

targetAction -> (string)

The name of the action in a pipeline you want to connect to the webhook. The action must be from the source (first) stage of the pipeline.

filters -> (list)

A list of rules applied to the body/payload sent in the POST request to a webhook URL. All defined rules must pass for the request to be accepted and the pipeline started.

(structure)

The event criteria that specify when a webhook notification is sent to your URL.

jsonPath -> (string)

A JsonPath expression that is applied to the body/payload of the webhook. The value selected by the JsonPath expression must match the value specified in the `MatchEquals` field. Otherwise, the request is ignored. For more information, see [Java JsonPath implementation](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath) in GitHub.

matchEquals -> (string)

The value selected by the `JsonPath` expression must match what is supplied in the `MatchEquals` field. Otherwise, the request is ignored. Properties from the target action configuration can be included as placeholders in this value by surrounding the action configuration key with curly brackets. For example, if the value supplied here is ârefs/heads/{Branch}â and the target action has an action configuration property called âBranchâ with a value of âmainâ, the `MatchEquals` value is evaluated as ârefs/heads/mainâ. For a list of action configuration properties for built-in action types, see [Pipeline Structure Reference Action Requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/reference-pipeline-structure.html#action-requirements) .

authentication -> (string)

Supported options are GITHUB_HMAC, IP, and UNAUTHENTICATED.

### Warning

When creating CodePipeline webhooks, do not use your own credentials or reuse the same secret token across multiple webhooks. For optimal security, generate a unique secret token for each webhook you create. The secret token is an arbitrary string that you provide, which GitHub uses to compute and sign the webhook payloads sent to CodePipeline, for protecting the integrity and authenticity of the webhook payloads. Using your own credentials or reusing the same token across multiple webhooks can lead to security vulnerabilities.

### Note

If a secret token was provided, it will be redacted in the response.

- For information about the authentication scheme implemented by GITHUB_HMAC, see [Securing your webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/) on the GitHub Developer website.
- IP rejects webhooks trigger requests unless they originate from an IP address in the IP range whitelisted in the authentication configuration.
- UNAUTHENTICATED accepts all webhook trigger requests regardless of origin.

authenticationConfiguration -> (structure)

Properties that configure the authentication applied to incoming webhook trigger requests. The required properties depend on the authentication type. For GITHUB_HMAC, only the `SecretToken` property must be set. For IP, only the `AllowedIPRange` property must be set to a valid CIDR range. For UNAUTHENTICATED, no properties can be set.

AllowedIPRange -> (string)

The property used to configure acceptance of webhooks in an IP address range. For IP, only the `AllowedIPRange` property must be set. This property must be set to a valid CIDR range.

SecretToken -> (string)

The property used to configure GitHub authentication. For GITHUB_HMAC, only the `SecretToken` property must be set.

    "AllowedIPRange": "string",
    "SecretToken": "string"
  }
}
```

`--tags` (list)

The tags for the webhook.

(structure)

A tag is a key-value pair that is used to manage the resource.

key -> (string)

The tagâs key.

value -> (string)

The tagâs value.

Shorthand Syntax:

```
key=string,value=string ...
```

JSON Syntax:

```
[
  {
    "key": "string",
    "value": "string"
  }
  ...
]
```

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To create a webhook**

The following `put-webhook` example creates a webhook for a GitHub version 1 source action. After you create the webhook, you must use the register-webhook-with-third-party command to register it.

```
aws codepipeline put-webhook \
    --cli-input-json file://webhook_json.json \
    --region "eu-central-1"
```

Contents of `webhook_json.json`:

```
{
    "webhook": {
        "name": "my-webhook",
        "targetPipeline": "pipeline_name",
        "targetAction": "source_action_name",
        "filters": [
            {
                "jsonPath": "$.ref",
                "matchEquals": "refs/heads/{Branch}"
            }
        ],
        "authentication": "GITHUB_HMAC",
        "authenticationConfiguration": {
            "SecretToken": "secret"
        }
    }
}
```

Output:

```
{
    "webhook": {
        "url": "https://webhooks.domain.com/trigger111111111EXAMPLE11111111111111111",

            "authenticationConfiguration": {
                "SecretToken": "secret"
            },
            "name": "my-webhook",
            "authentication": "GITHUB_HMAC",
            "targetPipeline": "pipeline_name",

            "filters": [
                {
                    "jsonPath": "$.ref",
                    "matchEquals": "refs/heads/{Branch}"
                }
            ]
        },
        "arn": "arn:aws:codepipeline:eu-central-1:123456789012:webhook:my-webhook"
    },
    "tags": [
        {
