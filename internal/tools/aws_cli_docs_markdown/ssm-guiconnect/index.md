## Description

Systems Manager GUI Connect, a component of Fleet Manager, lets you connect to your Window Server-type Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). GUI Connect, which is powered by [Amazon DCV](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/adminguide/what-is-dcv.html) , provides you with secure connectivity to your Windows Server instances directly from the Systems Manager console.
