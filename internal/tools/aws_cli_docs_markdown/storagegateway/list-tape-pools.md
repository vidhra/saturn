# list-tape-pools

## Description

Lists custom tape pools. You specify custom tape pools to list by specifying one or more custom tape pool Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). If you donât specify a custom tape pool ARN, the operation lists all custom tape pools.

This operation supports pagination. You can optionally specify the `Limit` parameter in the body to limit the number of tape pools in the response. If the number of tape pools returned in the response is truncated, the response includes a `Marker` element that you can use in your subsequent request to retrieve the next set of tape pools.

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/storagegateway-2013-06-30/ListTapePools)

`list-tape-pools` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the `--no-paginate` argument.
When using `--output text` and the `--query` argument on a paginated response, the `--query` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: `PoolInfos`

## Options

`--pool-arns` (list)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of each of the custom tape pools you want to list. If you donât specify a custom tape pool ARN, the response lists all custom tape pools.

(string)

Syntax:

```
"string" "string" ...
```

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--starting-token` (string)

A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the `NextToken` from a previously truncated response.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--page-size` (integer)

The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the commandâs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--max-items` (integer)

The total number of items to return in the commandâs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a `NextToken` is provided in the commandâs output. To resume pagination, provide the `NextToken` value in the `starting-token` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the `NextToken` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

PoolInfos -> (list)

An array of `PoolInfo` objects, where each object describes a single custom tape pool. If there are no custom tape pools, the `PoolInfos` is an empty array.

(structure)

Describes a custom tape pool.

PoolARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom tape pool. Use the  ListTapePools operation to return a list of custom tape pools for your account and Amazon Web Services Region.

PoolName -> (string)

The name of the custom tape pool. `PoolName` can use all ASCII characters, except â/â and â'.

StorageClass -> (string)

The storage class that is associated with the custom pool. When you use your backup application to eject the tape, the tape is archived directly into the storage class (S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive) that corresponds to the pool.

RetentionLockType -> (string)

Tape retention lock type, which can be configured in two modes. When configured in governance mode, Amazon Web Services accounts with specific IAM permissions are authorized to remove the tape retention lock from archived virtual tapes. When configured in compliance mode, the tape retention lock cannot be removed by any user, including the root Amazon Web Services account.

RetentionLockTimeInDays -> (integer)

Tape retention lock time is set in days. Tape retention lock can be enabled for up to 100 years (36,500 days).

PoolStatus -> (string)

Status of the custom tape pool. Pool can be `ACTIVE` or `DELETED` .

Marker -> (string)

A string that indicates the position at which to begin the returned list of tape pools. Use the marker in your next request to continue pagination of tape pools. If there are no more tape pools to list, this element does not appear in the response body.
