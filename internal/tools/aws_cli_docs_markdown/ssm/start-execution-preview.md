## Options

`--document-name` (string)

The name of the Automation runbook to run. The result of the execution preview indicates what the impact would be of running this runbook.

`--document-version` (string)

The version of the Automation runbook to run. The default value is `$DEFAULT` .

`--execution-inputs` (tagged union structure)

Information about the inputs that can be specified for the preview operation.

### Note

This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following top level keys can be set: `Automation`.

Automation -> (structure)

Information about the optional inputs that can be specified for an automation execution preview.

Parameters -> (map)

Information about parameters that can be specified for the preview operation.

(structure)

An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a key-value pair that you specify.

### Note

One or more targets must be specified for maintenance window Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the task, targets are optional for other maintenance window task types (Automation, Lambda, and Step Functions). For more information about running tasks that donât specify targets, see [Registering maintenance window tasks without targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/maintenance-windows-targetless-tasks.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide* .

For more information about how to send commands that target managed nodes using `Key,Value` parameters, see [Targeting multiple managed nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html#send-commands-targeting) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide* .

Key -> (string)

User-defined criteria for sending commands that target managed nodes that meet the criteria.

Values -> (list)

User-defined criteria that maps to `Key` . For example, if you specified `tag:ServerRole` , you could specify `value:WebServer` to run a command on instances that include EC2 tags of `ServerRole,WebServer` .

Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

(string)

TargetMaps -> (list)

A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both Targets and TargetMaps canât be specified together.

(map)

key -> (string)

TargetLocationMaxConcurrency -> (string)

The maximum number of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web Services accounts allowed to run the Automation concurrently.

TargetLocationMaxErrors -> (string)

The maximum number of errors allowed before the system stops queueing additional Automation executions for the currently running Automation.

ExecutionRoleName -> (string)

The Automation execution role used by the currently running Automation. If not specified, the default value is `AWS-SystemsManager-AutomationExecutionRole` .

TargetLocationAlarmConfiguration -> (structure)

The details for the CloudWatch alarm you want to apply to an automation or command.

IgnorePollAlarmFailure -> (boolean)

When this value is *true* , your automation or command continues to run in cases where we canât retrieve alarm status information from CloudWatch. In cases where we successfully retrieve an alarm status of OK or INSUFFICIENT_DATA, the automation or command continues to run, regardless of this value. Default is *false* .

Alarms -> (list)

The name of the CloudWatch alarm specified in the configuration.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

ExecutionPreviewId -> (string)

The ID of the execution preview generated by the system.
