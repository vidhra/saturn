# describe-account-attributes

## Description

Lists all of the DMS attributes for a customer account. These attributes include DMS quotas for the account and a unique account identifier in a particular DMS region. DMS quotas include a list of resource quotas supported by the account, such as the number of replication instances allowed. The description for each resource quota, includes the quota name, current usage toward that quota, and the quotaâs maximum value. DMS uses the unique account identifier to name each artifact used by DMS in the given region.

This command does not take any parameters.

```

## Options

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To describe account attributes**

The following `describe-account-attributes` example lists the attributes for your AWS account.

```
aws dms describe-account-attributes
```

Output:

```
{
    "AccountQuotas": [
        {
            "AccountQuotaName": "ReplicationInstances",
            "Used": 1,
            "Max": 20
        },
        {
            "AccountQuotaName": "AllocatedStorage",
            "Used": 5,
            "Max": 10000
        },

        ...remaining output omitted...

    ],
    "UniqueAccountIdentifier": "cqahfbfy5xee"
}
```

## Output

AccountQuotas -> (list)

Account quota information.

(structure)

Describes a quota for an Amazon Web Services account, for example the number of replication instances allowed.

AccountQuotaName -> (string)

The name of the DMS quota for this Amazon Web Services account.

Used -> (long)

The amount currently used toward the quota maximum.

Max -> (long)

The maximum allowed value for the quota.

UniqueAccountIdentifier -> (string)

A unique DMS identifier for an account in a particular Amazon Web Services Region. The value of this identifier has the following format: `c99999999999` . DMS uses this identifier to name artifacts. For example, DMS uses this identifier to name the default Amazon S3 bucket for storing task assessment reports in a given Amazon Web Services Region. The format of this S3 bucket name is the following: `dms-*AccountNumber* -*UniqueAccountIdentifier* .` Here is an example name for this default S3 bucket: `dms-111122223333-c44445555666` .

### Note

DMS supports the `UniqueAccountIdentifier` parameter in versions 3.1.4 and later.
