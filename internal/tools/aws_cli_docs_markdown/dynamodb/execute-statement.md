# execute-statement

## Description

This operation allows you to perform reads and singleton writes on data stored in DynamoDB, using PartiQL.

For PartiQL reads (`SELECT` statement), if the total number of processed items exceeds the maximum dataset size limit of 1 MB, the read stops and results are returned to the user as a `LastEvaluatedKey` value to continue the read in a subsequent operation. If the filter criteria in `WHERE` clause does not match any data, the read will return an empty result set.

A single `SELECT` statement response can return up to the maximum number of items (if using the Limit parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data (and then apply any filtering to the results using `WHERE` clause). If `LastEvaluatedKey` is present in the response, you need to paginate the result set. If `NextToken` is present, you need to paginate the result set and include `NextToken` .

```

`--consistent-read` | `--no-consistent-read` (boolean)

The consistency of a read operation. If set to `true` , then a strongly consistent read is used; otherwise, an eventually consistent read is used.

`--next-token` (string)

Set this value to get remaining results, if `NextToken` was returned in the statement response.

`--return-consumed-capacity` (string)

Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput consumption that is returned in the response:

- `INDEXES` - The response includes the aggregate `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation, together with `ConsumedCapacity` for each table and secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such as `GetItem` and `BatchGetItem` , do not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying `INDEXES` will only return `ConsumedCapacity` information for table(s).
- `TOTAL` - The response includes only the aggregate `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation.
- `NONE` - No `ConsumedCapacity` details are included in the response.

Possible values:

- `INDEXES`
- `TOTAL`
- `NONE`

`--limit` (integer)

The maximum number of items to evaluate (not necessarily the number of matching items). If DynamoDB processes the number of items up to the limit while processing the results, it stops the operation and returns the matching values up to that point, along with a key in `LastEvaluatedKey` to apply in a subsequent operation so you can pick up where you left off. Also, if the processed dataset size exceeds 1 MB before DynamoDB reaches this limit, it stops the operation and returns the matching values up to the limit, and a key in `LastEvaluatedKey` to apply in a subsequent operation to continue the operation.

`--return-values-on-condition-check-failure` (string)

An optional parameter that returns the item attributes for an `ExecuteStatement` operation that failed a condition check.

There is no additional cost associated with requesting a return value aside from the small network and processing overhead of receiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed.

Possible values:

- `ALL_OLD`
- `NONE`

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

(structure)

Represents the data for an attribute.

Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

For more information, see [Data Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html#HowItWorks.DataTypes) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide* .

S -> (string)

An attribute of type String. For example:

`"S": "Hello"`

N -> (string)

An attribute of type Number. For example:

`"N": "123.45"`

Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations.

B -> (blob)

An attribute of type Binary. For example:

`"B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"`

SS -> (list)

An attribute of type String Set. For example:

`"SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]`

(string)

NS -> (list)

An attribute of type Number Set. For example:

`"NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]`

Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations.
