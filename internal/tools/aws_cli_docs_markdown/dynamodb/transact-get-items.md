# transact-get-items

## Description

`TransactGetItems` is a synchronous operation that atomically retrieves multiple items from one or more tables (but not from indexes) in a single account and Region. A `TransactGetItems` call can contain up to 100 `TransactGetItem` objects, each of which contains a `Get` structure that specifies an item to retrieve from a table in the account and Region. A call to `TransactGetItems` cannot retrieve items from tables in more than one Amazon Web Services account or Region. The aggregate size of the items in the transaction cannot exceed 4 MB.

DynamoDB rejects the entire `TransactGetItems` request if any of the following is true:

- A conflicting operation is in the process of updating an item to be read.
- There is insufficient provisioned capacity for the transaction to be completed.
- There is a user error, such as an invalid data format.
- The aggregate size of the items in the transaction exceeded 4 MB.

(structure)

Specifies an item to be retrieved as part of the transaction.

Get -> (structure)

Contains the primary key that identifies the item to get, together with the name of the table that contains the item, and optionally the specific attributes of the item to retrieve.

`--return-consumed-capacity` (string)

A value of `TOTAL` causes consumed capacity information to be returned, and a value of `NONE` prevents that information from being returned. No other value is valid.

Possible values:

- `INDEXES`
- `TOTAL`
- `NONE`

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To retrieve multiple items atomically from one or more tables**

The following `transact-get-items` example retrieves multiple items atomically.

```
aws dynamodb transact-get-items \
    --transact-items file://transact-items.json \
    --return-consumed-capacity TOTAL
```

Contents of `transact-items.json`:

```
[
    {
        "Get": {
            "Key": {
                "Artist": {"S": "Acme Band"},
                "SongTitle": {"S": "Happy Day"}
            },
            "TableName": "MusicCollection"
        }
    },
    {
        "Get": {
            "Key": {
                "Artist": {"S": "No One You Know"},
                "SongTitle": {"S": "Call Me Today"}
            },
            "TableName": "MusicCollection"
        }
    }

## Output

ConsumedCapacity -> (list)

If the *ReturnConsumedCapacity* value was `TOTAL` , this is an array of `ConsumedCapacity` objects, one for each table addressed by `TransactGetItem` objects in the *TransactItems* parameter. These `ConsumedCapacity` objects report the read-capacity units consumed by the `TransactGetItems` call in that table.

(structure)

The capacity units consumed by an operation. The data returned includes the total provisioned throughput consumed, along with statistics for the table and any indexes involved in the operation. `ConsumedCapacity` is only returned if the request asked for it.

An attribute of type Number. For example:

`"N": "123.45"`

Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations.

B -> (blob)

An attribute of type Binary. For example:

`"B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"`

SS -> (list)

An attribute of type String Set. For example:

(string)

NS -> (list)

An attribute of type Number Set. For example:

`"NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]`

Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations.
