# transact-write-items

## Description

`TransactWriteItems` is a synchronous write operation that groups up to 100 action requests. These actions can target items in different tables, but not in different Amazon Web Services accounts or Regions, and no two actions can target the same item. For example, you cannot both `ConditionCheck` and `Update` the same item. The aggregate size of the items in the transaction cannot exceed 4 MB.

The actions are completed atomically so that either all of them succeed, or all of them fail. They are defined by the following objects:

- `Put` â Initiates a `PutItem` operation to write a new item. This structure specifies the primary key of the item to be written, the name of the table to write it in, an optional condition expression that must be satisfied for the write to succeed, a list of the itemâs attributes, and a field indicating whether to retrieve the itemâs attributes if the condition is not met.
- `Update` â Initiates an `UpdateItem` operation to update an existing item. This structure specifies the primary key of the item to be updated, the name of the table where it resides, an optional condition expression that must be satisfied for the update to succeed, an expression that defines one or more attributes to be updated, and a field indicating whether to retrieve the itemâs attributes if the condition is not met.
- `Delete` â Initiates a `DeleteItem` operation to delete an existing item. This structure specifies the primary key of the item to be deleted, the name of the table where it resides, an optional condition expression that must be satisfied for the deletion to succeed, and a field indicating whether to retrieve the itemâs attributes if the condition is not met.
- `ConditionCheck` â Applies a condition to an item that is not being modified by the transaction. This structure specifies the primary key of the item to be checked, the name of the table where it resides, a condition expression that must be satisfied for the transaction to succeed, and a field indicating whether to retrieve the itemâs attributes if the condition is not met.

DynamoDB rejects the entire `TransactWriteItems` request if any of the following is true:

- A condition in one of the condition expressions is not met.
- An ongoing operation is in the process of updating the same item.
- There is insufficient provisioned capacity for the transaction to be completed.
- An item size becomes too large (bigger than 400 KB), a local secondary index (LSI) becomes too large, or a similar validation error occurs because of changes made by the transaction.
- The aggregate size of the items in the transaction exceeds 4 MB.
- There is a user error, such as an invalid data format.

## Options

`--transact-items` (list)

An ordered array of up to 100 `TransactWriteItem` objects, each of which contains a `ConditionCheck` , `Put` , `Update` , or `Delete` object. These can operate on items in different tables, but the tables must reside in the same Amazon Web Services account and Region, and no two of them can operate on the same item.

(structure)

A list of requests that can perform update, put, delete, or check operations on multiple items in one or more tables atomically.

ConditionCheck -> (structure)

A request to perform a check item operation.

Key -> (map)

The primary key of the item to be checked. Each element consists of an attribute name and a value for that attribute.

key -> (string)

value -> (structure)

Represents the data for an attribute.

Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

`--return-consumed-capacity` (string)

Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput consumption that is returned in the response:

- `INDEXES` - The response includes the aggregate `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation, together with `ConsumedCapacity` for each table and secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such as `GetItem` and `BatchGetItem` , do not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying `INDEXES` will only return `ConsumedCapacity` information for table(s).
- `TOTAL` - The response includes only the aggregate `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation.
- `NONE` - No `ConsumedCapacity` details are included in the response.

Possible values:

- `INDEXES`
- `TOTAL`
- `NONE`

`--return-item-collection-metrics` (string)

Determines whether item collection metrics are returned. If set to `SIZE` , the response includes statistics about item collections (if any), that were modified during the operation and are returned in the response. If set to `NONE` (the default), no statistics are returned.

Possible values:

- `SIZE`
- `NONE`

`--client-request-token` (string)

Providing a `ClientRequestToken` makes the call to `TransactWriteItems` idempotent, meaning that multiple identical calls have the same effect as one single call.

Although multiple identical calls using the same client request token produce the same result on the server (no side effects), the responses to the calls might not be the same. If the `ReturnConsumedCapacity` parameter is set, then the initial `TransactWriteItems` call returns the amount of write capacity units consumed in making the changes. Subsequent `TransactWriteItems` calls with the same client token return the number of read capacity units consumed in reading the item.

A client request token is valid for 10 minutes after the first request that uses it is completed. After 10 minutes, any request with the same client token is treated as a new request. Do not resubmit the same request with the same client token for more than 10 minutes, or the result might not be idempotent.

If you submit a request with the same client token but a change in other parameters within the 10-minute idempotency window, DynamoDB returns an `IdempotentParameterMismatch` exception.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**Example 1: To write items atomically to one or more tables**

The following `transact-write-items` example updates one item and deletes another. The operation fails if either operation fails, or if either item contains a `Rating` attribute.

```
aws dynamodb transact-write-items \
    --transact-items file://transact-items.json \
    --return-consumed-capacity TOTAL \
    --return-item-collection-metrics SIZE
```

Contents of the `transact-items.json` file:

```
[
    {
        "Update": {
            "Key": {
                "Artist": {"S": "Acme Band"},
                "SongTitle": {"S": "Happy Day"}
            },
            "UpdateExpression": "SET AlbumTitle = :newval",
            "ExpressionAttributeValues": {
                ":newval": {"S": "Updated Album Title"}
            },
            "TableName": "MusicCollection",
            "ConditionExpression": "attribute_not_exists(Rating)"
        }
    },
    {

```

Output:

```

        {
            "TableName": "MusicCollection",
            "CapacityUnits": 10.0,

**Example 2: To write items atomically using a client request token**

The following command uses a client request token to make the call to `transact-write-items` idempotent, meaning that multiple calls have the same effect as one single call.

```
aws dynamodb transact-write-items \
    --transact-items file://transact-items.json \
    --client-request-token abc123
```

Contents of the `transact-items.json` file:

```
[
    {
        "Update": {
            "Key": {
                "Artist": {"S": "Acme Band"},
                "SongTitle": {"S": "Happy Day"}
            },
            "UpdateExpression": "SET AlbumTitle = :newval",
            "ExpressionAttributeValues": {
                ":newval": {"S": "Updated Album Title"}
            },
            "TableName": "MusicCollection",
            "ConditionExpression": "attribute_not_exists(Rating)"
        }
    },
    {
        "Delete": {
            "Key": {
                "Artist": {"S": "No One You Know"},
                "SongTitle": {"S": "Call Me Today"}
            },
            "TableName": "MusicCollection",
            "ConditionExpression": "attribute_not_exists(Rating)"
        }
    }
]
```

This command produces no output.
