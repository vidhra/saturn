# put-item

## Description

Creates a new item, or replaces an old item with a new item. If an item that has the same primary key as the new item already exists in the specified table, the new item completely replaces the existing item. You can perform a conditional put operation (add a new item if one with the specified primary key doesnât exist), or replace an existing item if it has certain attribute values. You can return the itemâs attribute values in the same operation, using the `ReturnValues` parameter.

When you add an item, the primary key attributes are the only required attributes.

Empty String and Binary attribute values are allowed. Attribute values of type String and Binary must have a length greater than zero if the attribute is used as a key attribute for a table or index. Set type attributes cannot be empty.

Invalid Requests with empty values will be rejected with a `ValidationException` exception.

### Note

To prevent a new item from replacing an existing item, use a conditional expression that contains the `attribute_not_exists` function with the name of the attribute being used as the partition key for the table. Since every record must contain that attribute, the `attribute_not_exists` function will only succeed if no matching item exists.

For more information about `PutItem` , see [Working with Items](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide* .

## Options

`--table-name` (string)

The name of the table to contain the item. You can also provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parameter.

`--item` (map)

A map of attribute name/value pairs, one for each attribute. Only the primary key attributes are required; you can optionally provide other attribute name-value pairs for the item.

You must provide all of the attributes for the primary key. For example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for the partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide both values for both the partition key and the sort key.

If you specify any attributes that are part of an index key, then the data types for those attributes must match those of the schema in the tableâs attribute definition.

Empty String and Binary attribute values are allowed. Attribute values of type String and Binary must have a length greater than zero if the attribute is used as a key attribute for a table or index.

For more information about primary keys, see [Primary Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html#HowItWorks.CoreComponents.PrimaryKey) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide* .

Each element in the `Item` map is an `AttributeValue` object.

`--expected` (map)

This is a legacy parameter. Use `ConditionExpression` instead. For more information, see [Expected](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/LegacyConditionalParameters.Expected.html) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide* .

key -> (string)

value -> (structure)

Represents a condition to be compared with an attribute value. This condition can be used with `DeleteItem` , `PutItem` , or `UpdateItem` operations; if the comparison evaluates to true, the operation succeeds; if not, the operation fails. You can use `ExpectedAttributeValue` in one of two different ways:

- Use `AttributeValueList` to specify one or more values to compare against an attribute. Use `ComparisonOperator` to specify how you want to perform the comparison. If the comparison evaluates to true, then the conditional operation succeeds.
- Use `Value` to specify a value that DynamoDB will compare against an attribute. If the values match, then `ExpectedAttributeValue` evaluates to true and the conditional operation succeeds. Optionally, you can also set `Exists` to false, indicating that you *do not* expect to find the attribute value in the table. In this case, the conditional operation succeeds only if the comparison evaluates to false.

`Value` and `Exists` are incompatible with `AttributeValueList` and `ComparisonOperator` . Note that if you use both sets of parameters at once, DynamoDB will return a `ValidationException` exception.

Value -> (structure)

Represents the data for the expected attribute.

Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

BOOL -> (boolean)

An attribute of type Boolean. For example:

Exists -> (boolean)

Causes DynamoDB to evaluate the value before attempting a conditional operation:

- If `Exists` is `true` , DynamoDB will check to see if that attribute value already exists in the table. If it is found, then the operation succeeds. If it is not found, the operation fails with a `ConditionCheckFailedException` .
- If `Exists` is `false` , DynamoDB assumes that the attribute value does not exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then the assumption is valid and the operation succeeds. If the value is found, despite the assumption that it does not exist, the operation fails with a `ConditionCheckFailedException` .

The default setting for `Exists` is `true` . If you supply a `Value` all by itself, DynamoDB assumes the attribute exists: You donât have to set `Exists` to `true` , because it is implied.

DynamoDB returns a `ValidationException` if:

- `Exists` is `true` but there is no `Value` to check. (You expect a value to exist, but donât specify what that value is.)
- `Exists` is `false` but you also provide a `Value` . (You cannot expect an attribute to have a value, while also expecting it not to exist.)

ComparisonOperator -> (string)

A comparator for evaluating attributes in the `AttributeValueList` . For example, equals, greater than, less than, etc.

The following comparison operators are available:

`EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN`

The following are descriptions of each comparison operator.

- `EQ` : Equal. `EQ` is supported for all data types, including lists and maps.  `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an `AttributeValue` element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}` . Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not equal `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}` .
- `NE` : Not equal. `NE` is supported for all data types, including lists and maps.  `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an `AttributeValue` of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}` . Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not equal `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}` .
- `LE` : Less than or equal.   `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an `AttributeValue` element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}` . Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}` .
- `LT` : Less than.   `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an `AttributeValue` element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}` . Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}` .
- `GE` : Greater than or equal.   `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an `AttributeValue` element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}` . Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}` .
- `GT` : Greater than.   `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an `AttributeValue` element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}` . Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}` .
- `NOT_NULL` : The attribute exists. `NOT_NULL` is supported for all data types, including lists and maps.

### Note

This operator tests for the existence of an attribute, not its data type. If the data type of attribute â`a` â is null, and you evaluate it using `NOT_NULL` , the result is a Boolean `true` . This result is because the attribute â`a` â exists; its data type is not relevant to the `NOT_NULL` comparison operator.

- `NULL` : The attribute does not exist. `NULL` is supported for all data types, including lists and maps.

### Note

This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute, not its data type. If the data type of attribute â`a` â is null, and you evaluate it using `NULL` , the result is a Boolean `false` . This is because the attribute â`a` â exists; its data type is not relevant to the `NULL` comparison operator.

- `CONTAINS` : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set.  `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (â`SS` â, â`NS` â, or â`BS` â), then the operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the set. CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating â`a CONTAINS b` â, â`a` â can be a list; however, â`b` â cannot be a set, a map, or a list.
- `NOT_CONTAINS` : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set.  `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the comparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (â`SS` â, â`NS` â, or â`BS` â), then the operator evaluates to true if it *does not* find an exact match with any member of the set. NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating â`a NOT CONTAINS b` â, â`a` â can be a list; however, â`b` â cannot be a set, a map, or a list.
- `BEGINS_WITH` : Checks for a prefix.   `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison must be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type).
- `IN` : Checks for matching elements in a list.  `AttributeValueList` can contain one or more `AttributeValue` elements of type String, Number, or Binary. These attributes are compared against an existing attribute of an item. If any elements of the input are equal to the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true.
- `BETWEEN` : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value.   `AttributeValueList` must contain two `AttributeValue` elements of the same type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute matches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element and less than, or equal to, the second element. If an item contains an `AttributeValue` element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not compare to `{"N":"6"}` . Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`

AttributeValueList -> (list)

One or more values to evaluate against the supplied attribute. The number of values in the list depends on the `ComparisonOperator` being used.

For type Number, value comparisons are numeric.

String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or less than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, `a` is greater than `A` , and `a` is greater than `B` . For a list of code values, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters) .

For Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned when it compares binary values.

For information on specifying data types in JSON, see [JSON Data Format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DataFormat.html) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide* .

(structure)

Represents the data for an attribute.

Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

`--return-values` (string)

Use `ReturnValues` if you want to get the item attributes as they appeared before they were updated with the `PutItem` request. For `PutItem` , the valid values are:

- `NONE` - If `ReturnValues` is not specified, or if its value is `NONE` , then nothing is returned. (This setting is the default for `ReturnValues` .)
- `ALL_OLD` - If `PutItem` overwrote an attribute name-value pair, then the content of the old item is returned.

The values returned are strongly consistent.

There is no additional cost associated with requesting a return value aside from the small network and processing overhead of receiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed.

### Note

The `ReturnValues` parameter is used by several DynamoDB operations; however, `PutItem` does not recognize any values other than `NONE` or `ALL_OLD` .

Possible values:

- `NONE`
- `ALL_OLD`
- `UPDATED_OLD`
- `ALL_NEW`
- `UPDATED_NEW`

`--return-consumed-capacity` (string)

Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput consumption that is returned in the response:

- `INDEXES` - The response includes the aggregate `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation, together with `ConsumedCapacity` for each table and secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such as `GetItem` and `BatchGetItem` , do not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying `INDEXES` will only return `ConsumedCapacity` information for table(s).
- `TOTAL` - The response includes only the aggregate `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation.
- `NONE` - No `ConsumedCapacity` details are included in the response.

Possible values:

- `INDEXES`
- `TOTAL`
- `NONE`

`--return-item-collection-metrics` (string)

Determines whether item collection metrics are returned. If set to `SIZE` , the response includes statistics about item collections, if any, that were modified during the operation are returned in the response. If set to `NONE` (the default), no statistics are returned.

Possible values:

- `SIZE`
- `NONE`

`--conditional-operator` (string)

This is a legacy parameter. Use `ConditionExpression` instead. For more information, see [ConditionalOperator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/LegacyConditionalParameters.ConditionalOperator.html) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide* .

Possible values:

- `AND`
- `OR`

`--condition-expression` (string)

A condition that must be satisfied in order for a conditional `PutItem` operation to succeed.

An expression can contain any of the following:

- Functions: `attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists | attribute_type | contains | begins_with | size`   These function names are case-sensitive.
- Comparison operators: `= | <> | < | > | <= | >= | BETWEEN | IN`
- Logical operators: `AND | OR | NOT`

For more information on condition expressions, see [Condition Expressions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.SpecifyingConditions.html) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide* .

`--expression-attribute-names` (map)

One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following are some use cases for using `ExpressionAttributeNames` :

- To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.
- To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.
- To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.

Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name:

- `Percentile`

The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see [Reserved Words](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ReservedWords.html) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide* ). To work around this, you could specify the following for `ExpressionAttributeNames` :

- `{"#P":"Percentile"}`

You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:

- `#P = :val`

### Note

Tokens that begin with the **:** character are *expression attribute values* , which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.

For more information on expression attribute names, see [Specifying Item Attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.AccessingItemAttributes.html) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide* .

JSON Syntax:

```

```

`--expression-attribute-values` (map)

One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.

Use the **:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the *ProductStatus* attribute was one of the following:

`Available | Backordered | Discontinued`

You would first need to specify `ExpressionAttributeValues` as follows:

`{ ":avail":{"S":"Available"}, ":back":{"S":"Backordered"}, ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }`

You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:

`ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)`

`--return-values-on-condition-check-failure` (string)

An optional parameter that returns the item attributes for a `PutItem` operation that failed a condition check.

There is no additional cost associated with requesting a return value aside from the small network and processing overhead of receiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed.

Possible values:

- `ALL_OLD`
- `NONE`

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**Example 1: To add an item to a table**

The following `put-item` example adds a new item to the *MusicCollection* table.

```
aws dynamodb put-item \
    --table-name MusicCollection \
    --item file://item.json \
    --return-consumed-capacity TOTAL \
    --return-item-collection-metrics SIZE
```

Contents of `item.json`:

```
{
    "Artist": {"S": "No One You Know"},
    "SongTitle": {"S": "Call Me Today"},
    "AlbumTitle": {"S": "Greatest Hits"}
}
```

Output:

```
{
    "ConsumedCapacity": {
        "TableName": "MusicCollection",
        "CapacityUnits": 1.0
    },
    "ItemCollectionMetrics": {
        "ItemCollectionKey": {
            "Artist": {
                "S": "No One You Know"
            }
        },
        "SizeEstimateRangeGB": [
            0.0,
            1.0
        ]
    }
}
```

For more information, see [Writing an Item](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html#WorkingWithItems.WritingData) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

**Example 2: To conditionally overwrite an item in a table**

The following `put-item` example overwrites an existing item in the `MusicCollection` table only if that existing item has an `AlbumTitle` attribute with a value of `Greatest Hits`. The command returns the previous value of the item.

```
aws dynamodb put-item \
    --table-name MusicCollection \
    --item file://item.json \
    --condition-expression "#A = :A" \
    --expression-attribute-names file://names.json \
    --expression-attribute-values file://values.json \
    --return-values ALL_OLD
```

Contents of `item.json`:

```
{
    "Artist": {"S": "No One You Know"},
    "SongTitle": {"S": "Call Me Today"},
    "AlbumTitle": {"S": "Somewhat Famous"}
}
```

Contents of `names.json`:

```
{
    "#A": "AlbumTitle"
}
```

Contents of `values.json`:

```
{
    ":A": {"S": "Greatest Hits"}
}
```

Output:

```
{
    "Attributes": {
        "AlbumTitle": {
            "S": "Greatest Hits"
        },
        "Artist": {
            "S": "No One You Know"
        },
        "SongTitle": {
            "S": "Call Me Today"
        }
    }
}
```

If the key already exists, you should see the following output:

```
A client error (ConditionalCheckFailedException) occurred when calling the PutItem operation: The conditional request failed.
```
