# batch-execute-statement

## Description

This operation allows you to perform batch reads or writes on data stored in DynamoDB, using PartiQL. Each read statement in a `BatchExecuteStatement` must specify an equality condition on all key attributes. This enforces that each `SELECT` statement in a batch returns at most a single item. For more information, see [Running batch operations with PartiQL for DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference.multiplestatements.batching.html) .

### Note

The entire batch must consist of either read statements or write statements, you cannot mix both in one batch.

### Warning

A HTTP 200 response does not mean that all statements in the BatchExecuteStatement succeeded. Error details for individual statements can be found under the [Error](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_BatchStatementResponse.html#DDB-Type-BatchStatementResponse-Error) field of the `BatchStatementResponse` for each statement.

`--return-consumed-capacity` (string)

Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput consumption that is returned in the response:

- `INDEXES` - The response includes the aggregate `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation, together with `ConsumedCapacity` for each table and secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such as `GetItem` and `BatchGetItem` , do not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying `INDEXES` will only return `ConsumedCapacity` information for table(s).
- `TOTAL` - The response includes only the aggregate `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation.
- `NONE` - No `ConsumedCapacity` details are included in the response.

Possible values:

- `INDEXES`
- `TOTAL`
- `NONE`

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

ConsumedCapacity -> (list)

The capacity units consumed by the entire operation. The values of the list are ordered according to the ordering of the statements.

(structure)

The capacity units consumed by an operation. The data returned includes the total provisioned throughput consumed, along with statistics for the table and any indexes involved in the operation. `ConsumedCapacity` is only returned if the request asked for it. For more information, see [Provisioned capacity mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/provisioned-capacity-mode.html) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide* .

TableName -> (string)

The name of the table that was affected by the operation. If you had specified the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a table in the input, youâll see the table ARN in the response.

CapacityUnits -> (double)

The total number of capacity units consumed by the operation.

ReadCapacityUnits -> (double)

The total number of read capacity units consumed by the operation.

WriteCapacityUnits -> (double)

The total number of write capacity units consumed by the operation.

Table -> (structure)

The amount of throughput consumed on the table affected by the operation.

ReadCapacityUnits -> (double)

The total number of read capacity units consumed on a table or an index.

WriteCapacityUnits -> (double)

The total number of write capacity units consumed on a table or an index.

CapacityUnits -> (double)

LocalSecondaryIndexes -> (map)

The amount of throughput consumed on each local index affected by the operation.

key -> (string)
