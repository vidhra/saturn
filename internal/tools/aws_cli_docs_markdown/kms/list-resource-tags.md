# list-resource-tags

## Description

Returns all tags on the specified KMS key.

For general information about tags, including the format and syntax, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* . For information about using tags in KMS, see [Tagging keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html) .

**Cross-account use** : No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

**Required permissions** : [kms:ListResourceTags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html) (key policy)

**Related operations:**

- CreateKey
- ReplicateKey
- TagResource
- UntagResource

**Eventual consistency** : The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see [KMS eventual consistency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/programming-eventual-consistency.html) .

`list-resource-tags` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the `--no-paginate` argument.
When using `--output text` and the `--query` argument on a paginated response, the `--query` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: `Tags`

## Options

`--key-id` (string)

Gets tags on the specified KMS key.

Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

For example:

- Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
- Key ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey .

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--starting-token` (string)

A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the `NextToken` from a previously truncated response.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--page-size` (integer)

The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the commandâs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--max-items` (integer)

The total number of items to return in the commandâs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a `NextToken` is provided in the commandâs output. To resume pagination, provide the `NextToken` value in the `starting-token` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the `NextToken` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To get the tags on a KMS key**

The following `list-resource-tags` example gets the tags for a KMS key. To add or replace resource tags on KMS keys, use the `tag-resource` command. The output shows that this KMS key has two resource tags, each of which has a key and value.

To specify the KMS key, use the `key-id` parameter. This example uses a key ID value, but you can use a key ID or key ARN in this command.

```
aws kms list-resource-tags \
    --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
```

Output:

```
{
    "Tags": [
    {
        "TagKey": "Dept",
        "TagValue": "IT"
    },
    {
        "TagKey": "Purpose",
        "TagValue": "Test"
    }
    ],
    "Truncated": false
}
```

For more information about using tags in AWS KMS, see [Tagging keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

## Output

Tags -> (list)

A list of tags. Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value.

### Note

Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For details, see [ABAC for KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html) in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

(structure)

A key-value pair. A tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Tag keys and tag values are both required, but tag values can be empty (null) strings.

### Warning

Do not include confidential or sensitive information in this field. This field may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.

For information about the rules that apply to tag keys and tag values, see [User-Defined Tag Restrictions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/allocation-tag-restrictions.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management User Guide* .

TagKey -> (string)

The key of the tag.

TagValue -> (string)

The value of the tag.

NextMarker -> (string)

When `Truncated` is true, this element is present and contains the value to use for the `Marker` parameter in a subsequent request.

Do not assume or infer any information from this value.

Truncated -> (boolean)

A flag that indicates whether there are more items in the list. When this value is true, the list in this response is truncated. To get more items, pass the value of the `NextMarker` element in this response to the `Marker` parameter in a subsequent request.
