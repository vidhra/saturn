# get-face-liveness-session-results

## Description

Retrieves the results of a specific Face Liveness session. It requires the `sessionId` as input, which was created using `CreateFaceLivenessSession` . Returns the corresponding Face Liveness confidence score, a reference image that includes a face bounding box, and audit images that also contain face bounding boxes. The Face Liveness confidence score ranges from 0 to 100.

The number of audit images returned by `GetFaceLivenessSessionResults` is defined by the `AuditImagesLimit` paramater when calling `CreateFaceLivenessSession` . Reference images are always returned when possible.

## Options

`--session-id` (string)

A unique 128-bit UUID. This is used to uniquely identify the session and also acts as an idempotency token for all operations associated with the session.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

SessionId -> (string)

The sessionId for which this request was called.

Status -> (string)

Represents a status corresponding to the state of the session. Possible statuses are: CREATED, IN_PROGRESS, SUCCEEDED, FAILED, EXPIRED.

Confidence -> (float)

Probabalistic confidence score for if the person in the given video was live, represented as a float value between 0 to 100.

ReferenceImage -> (structure)

A high-quality image from the Face Liveness video that can be used for face comparison or search. It includes a bounding box of the face and the Base64-encoded bytes that return an image. If the CreateFaceLivenessSession request included an OutputConfig argument, the image will be uploaded to an S3Object specified in the output configuration. In case the reference image is not returned, itâs recommended to retry the Liveness check.

Bytes -> (blob)

The Base64-encoded bytes representing an image selected from the Face Liveness video and returned for audit purposes.

S3Object -> (structure)

Provides the S3 bucket name and object name.

The region for the S3 bucket containing the S3 object must match the region you use for Amazon Rekognition operations.

For Amazon Rekognition to process an S3 object, the user must have permission to access the S3 object. For more information, see How Amazon Rekognition works with IAM in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

Bucket -> (string)

Name of the S3 bucket.

Name -> (string)

S3 object key name.

Version -> (string)

If the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify the object version.

BoundingBox -> (structure)

Identifies the bounding box around the label, face, text, object of interest, or personal protective equipment. The `left` (x-coordinate) and `top` (y-coordinate) are coordinates representing the top and left sides of the bounding box. Note that the upper-left corner of the image is the origin (0,0).

The `top` and `left` values returned are ratios of the overall image size. For example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the top-left coordinate of the bounding box is 350x50 pixels, the API returns a `left` value of 0.5 (350/700) and a `top` value of 0.25 (50/200).

The `width` and `height` values represent the dimensions of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall image dimension. For example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the bounding box width is 70 pixels, the width returned is 0.1.

### Note

The bounding box coordinates can have negative values. For example, if Amazon Rekognition is able to detect a face that is at the image edge and is only partially visible, the service can return coordinates that are outside the image bounds and, depending on the image edge, you might get negative values or values greater than 1 for the `left` or `top` values.

Width -> (float)

Width of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall image width.

Height -> (float)

Height of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall image height.

Left -> (float)

Left coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall image width.

Top -> (float)

Top coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall image height.

AuditImages -> (list)

A set of images from the Face Liveness video that can be used for audit purposes. It includes a bounding box of the face and the Base64-encoded bytes that return an image. If the CreateFaceLivenessSession request included an OutputConfig argument, the image will be uploaded to an S3Object specified in the output configuration. If no Amazon S3 bucket is defined, raw bytes are sent instead.

(structure)

An image that is picked from the Face Liveness video and returned for audit trail purposes, returned as Base64-encoded bytes.

Bytes -> (blob)

The Base64-encoded bytes representing an image selected from the Face Liveness video and returned for audit purposes.

S3Object -> (structure)

Provides the S3 bucket name and object name.

The region for the S3 bucket containing the S3 object must match the region you use for Amazon Rekognition operations.

For Amazon Rekognition to process an S3 object, the user must have permission to access the S3 object. For more information, see How Amazon Rekognition works with IAM in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

Bucket -> (string)

Name of the S3 bucket.

Name -> (string)

S3 object key name.

Version -> (string)

If the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify the object version.

BoundingBox -> (structure)

Identifies the bounding box around the label, face, text, object of interest, or personal protective equipment. The `left` (x-coordinate) and `top` (y-coordinate) are coordinates representing the top and left sides of the bounding box. Note that the upper-left corner of the image is the origin (0,0).

The `top` and `left` values returned are ratios of the overall image size. For example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the top-left coordinate of the bounding box is 350x50 pixels, the API returns a `left` value of 0.5 (350/700) and a `top` value of 0.25 (50/200).

The `width` and `height` values represent the dimensions of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall image dimension. For example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the bounding box width is 70 pixels, the width returned is 0.1.

### Note

The bounding box coordinates can have negative values. For example, if Amazon Rekognition is able to detect a face that is at the image edge and is only partially visible, the service can return coordinates that are outside the image bounds and, depending on the image edge, you might get negative values or values greater than 1 for the `left` or `top` values.

Width -> (float)

Width of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall image width.

Height -> (float)

Height of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall image height.

Left -> (float)

Left coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall image width.

Top -> (float)

Top coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall image height.
