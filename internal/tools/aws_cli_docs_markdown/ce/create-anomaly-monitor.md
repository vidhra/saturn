## Options

`--anomaly-monitor` (structure)

The cost anomaly detection monitor object that you want to create.

MonitorArn -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) value.

MonitorName -> (string)

The name of the monitor.

CreationDate -> (string)

The date when the monitor was created.

LastUpdatedDate -> (string)

The date when the monitor was last updated.

LastEvaluatedDate -> (string)

The date when the monitor last evaluated for anomalies.

MonitorType -> (string)

The possible type values.

MonitorDimension -> (string)

The dimensions to evaluate.

MonitorSpecification -> (structure)

Use `Expression` to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

Not all `Expression` types are supported in each API. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported.

There are two patterns:

- Simple dimension values.
- There are three types of simple dimension values: `CostCategories` , `Tags` , and `Dimensions` .
- Specify the `CostCategories` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Categories.
- Specify the `Tags` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Allocation Tags.
- Specify the `Dimensions` field to define a filter that acts on the ` `DimensionValues` [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues).html`__ .
- For each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use.
- For example, you can filter for `REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1` . For `GetRightsizingRecommendation` , the Region is a full name (for example, `REGION==US East (N. Virginia)` .
- The corresponding `Expression` for this example is as follows: `{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }`
- As shown in the previous example, lists of dimension values are combined with `OR` when applying the filter.
- You can also set different match options to further control how the filter behaves. Not all APIs support match options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported.
- For example, you can filter for linked account names that start with âaâ.
- The corresponding `Expression` for this example is as follows: `{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME", "MatchOptions": [ "STARTS_WITH" ], "Values": [ "a" ] } }`
- Compound `Expression` types with logical operations.
- You can use multiple `Expression` types and the logical operators `AND/OR/NOT` to create a list of one or more `Expression` objects. By doing this, you can filter by more advanced options.
- For example, you can filter by `((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)` .
- The corresponding `Expression` for this example is as follows: `{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }`

### Note

Because each `Expression` can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an `Expression` object that creates an error: `{ "And": [ ... ], "Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }`

The following is an example of the corresponding error message: `"Expression has more than one roots. Only one root operator is allowed for each expression: And, Or, Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"`

### Note

For the `GetRightsizingRecommendation` action, a combination of OR and NOT isnât supported. OR isnât supported between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators arenât supported. Dimensions are also limited to `LINKED_ACCOUNT` , `REGION` , or `RIGHTSIZING_TYPE` .

For the `GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation` action, only NOT is supported. AND and OR arenât supported. Dimensions are limited to `LINKED_ACCOUNT` .

Or -> (list)

Return results that match either `Dimension` object.

`--resource-tags` (list)

An optional list of tags to associate with the specified ` `AnomalyMonitor` [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_AnomalyMonitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_AnomalyMonitor).html`__ . You can use resource tags to control access to your `monitor` using IAM policies.

Each tag consists of a key and a value, and each key must be unique for the resource. The following restrictions apply to resource tags:

- Although the maximum number of array members is 200, you can assign a maximum of 50 user-tags to one resource. The remaining are reserved for Amazon Web Services use
- The maximum length of a key is 128 characters
- The maximum length of a value is 256 characters
- Keys and values can only contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, and any of the following: `_.:/=+@-`
- Keys and values are case sensitive
- Keys and values are trimmed for any leading or trailing whitespaces
- Donât use `aws:` as a prefix for your keys. This prefix is reserved for Amazon Web Services use

(structure)

The tag structure that contains a tag key and value.

### Note

Tagging is supported only for the following Cost Explorer resource types: ` `AnomalyMonitor` [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_AnomalyMonitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_AnomalyMonitor).html`__ , ` `AnomalySubscription` [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_AnomalySubscription](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_AnomalySubscription).html`__ , ` `CostCategory` [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_CostCategory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_CostCategory).html`__ .

Key -> (string)

The key thatâs associated with the tag.

Value -> (string)

The value thatâs associated with the tag.

Shorthand Syntax:

```
Key=string,Value=string ...
```

JSON Syntax:

```
[
  {
    "Key": "string",
    "Value": "string"
  }
  ...
]
```

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

MonitorArn -> (string)

The unique identifier of your newly created cost anomaly detection monitor.
