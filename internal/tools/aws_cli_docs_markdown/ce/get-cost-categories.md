## Options

`--search-string` (string)

The value that you want to search the filter values for.

If you donât specify a `CostCategoryName` , `SearchString` is used to filter Cost Category names that match the `SearchString` pattern. If you specify a `CostCategoryName` , `SearchString` is used to filter Cost Category values that match the `SearchString` pattern.

`--time-period` (structure)

The time period of the request.

Start -> (string)

The beginning of the time period. The start date is inclusive. For example, if `start` is `2017-01-01` , Amazon Web Services retrieves cost and usage data starting at `2017-01-01` up to the end date. The start date must be equal to or no later than the current date to avoid a validation error.

End -> (string)

The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For example, if `end` is `2017-05-01` , Amazon Web Services retrieves cost and usage data from the start date up to, but not including, `2017-05-01` .

Shorthand Syntax:

```
Start=string,End=string
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{
  "Start": "string",
  "End": "string"
}
```

`--cost-category-name` (string)

The unique name of the Cost Category.

`--filter` (structure)

Use `Expression` to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

Not all `Expression` types are supported in each API. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported.

There are two patterns:

- Simple dimension values.
- There are three types of simple dimension values: `CostCategories` , `Tags` , and `Dimensions` .
- Specify the `CostCategories` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Categories.
- Specify the `Tags` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Allocation Tags.
- Specify the `Dimensions` field to define a filter that acts on the ` `DimensionValues` [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues).html`__ .
- For each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use.
- For example, you can filter for `REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1` . For `GetRightsizingRecommendation` , the Region is a full name (for example, `REGION==US East (N. Virginia)` .
- The corresponding `Expression` for this example is as follows: `{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }`
- As shown in the previous example, lists of dimension values are combined with `OR` when applying the filter.
- You can also set different match options to further control how the filter behaves. Not all APIs support match options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported.
- For example, you can filter for linked account names that start with âaâ.
- The corresponding `Expression` for this example is as follows: `{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME", "MatchOptions": [ "STARTS_WITH" ], "Values": [ "a" ] } }`
- Compound `Expression` types with logical operations.
- You can use multiple `Expression` types and the logical operators `AND/OR/NOT` to create a list of one or more `Expression` objects. By doing this, you can filter by more advanced options.
- For example, you can filter by `((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)` .
- The corresponding `Expression` for this example is as follows: `{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }`

### Note

Because each `Expression` can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an `Expression` object that creates an error: `{ "And": [ ... ], "Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }`

The following is an example of the corresponding error message: `"Expression has more than one roots. Only one root operator is allowed for each expression: And, Or, Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"`

### Note

For the `GetRightsizingRecommendation` action, a combination of OR and NOT isnât supported. OR isnât supported between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators arenât supported. Dimensions are also limited to `LINKED_ACCOUNT` , `REGION` , or `RIGHTSIZING_TYPE` .

For the `GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation` action, only NOT is supported. AND and OR arenât supported. Dimensions are limited to `LINKED_ACCOUNT` .

Or -> (list)

Return results that match either `Dimension` object.

`--sort-by` (list)

The value that you sort the data by.

The key represents the cost and usage metrics. The following values are supported:

- `BlendedCost`
- `UnblendedCost`
- `AmortizedCost`
- `NetAmortizedCost`
- `NetUnblendedCost`
- `UsageQuantity`
- `NormalizedUsageAmount`

The supported key values for the `SortOrder` value are `ASCENDING` and `DESCENDING` .

When you use the `SortBy` value, the `NextPageToken` and `SearchString` key values arenât supported.

(structure)

The details for how to sort the data.

Key -> (string)

The key thatâs used to sort the data.

SortOrder -> (string)

The order thatâs used to sort the data.

Shorthand Syntax:

```
Key=string,SortOrder=string ...
```

JSON Syntax:

```
[
  {
    "Key": "string",
    "SortOrder": "ASCENDING"|"DESCENDING"
  }
  ...
]
```

`--billing-view-arn` (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a specific billing view. The ARN is used to specify which particular billing view you want to interact with or retrieve information from when making API calls related to Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management features. The BillingViewArn can be retrieved by calling the ListBillingViews API.

`--max-results` (integer)

This field is only used when the `SortBy` value is provided in the request.

The maximum number of objects that are returned for this request. If `MaxResults` isnât specified with the `SortBy` value, the request returns 1000 results as the default value for this parameter.

For `GetCostCategories` , MaxResults has an upper quota of 1000.

`--next-page-token` (string)

If the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the quota, Amazon Web Services returns a NextPageToken value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, provide the NextPageToken from the previous call in your next request.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

NextPageToken -> (string)

If the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the quota, Amazon Web Services returns a NextPageToken value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in your next request.

CostCategoryNames -> (list)

The names of the Cost Categories.

(string)

The unique name of the Cost Category.

CostCategoryValues -> (list)

The Cost Category values.

If the `CostCategoryName` key isnât specified in the request, the `CostCategoryValues` fields arenât returned.

(string)

The default value for the cost category.

ReturnSize -> (integer)

The number of objects that are returned.

TotalSize -> (integer)

The total number of objects.
