# put-dashboard

## Description

Creates a dashboard if it does not already exist, or updates an existing dashboard. If you update a dashboard, the entire contents are replaced with what you specify here.

All dashboards in your account are global, not region-specific.

A simple way to create a dashboard using `PutDashboard` is to copy an existing dashboard. To copy an existing dashboard using the console, you can load the dashboard and then use the View/edit source command in the Actions menu to display the JSON block for that dashboard. Another way to copy a dashboard is to use `GetDashboard` , and then use the data returned within `DashboardBody` as the template for the new dashboard when you call `PutDashboard` .

When you create a dashboard with `PutDashboard` , a good practice is to add a text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message that the dashboard was created by script and should not be changed in the console. This message could also point console users to the location of the `DashboardBody` script or the CloudFormation template used to create the dashboard.

## Options

`--dashboard-name` (string)

The name of the dashboard. If a dashboard with this name already exists, this call modifies that dashboard, replacing its current contents. Otherwise, a new dashboard is created. The maximum length is 255, and valid characters are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, â-â, and â_â. This parameter is required.

`--dashboard-body` (string)

The detailed information about the dashboard in JSON format, including the widgets to include and their location on the dashboard. This parameter is required.

For more information about the syntax, see [Dashboard Body Structure and Syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/CloudWatch-Dashboard-Body-Structure.html) .

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To create a dashboard**

The following `put-dashboard` example creates a dashboard named `Dashboard-A` in the specified account.

```
aws cloudwatch put-dashboard \
    --dashboard-name Dashboard-A \
    --dashboard-body '{"widgets":[{"height":6,"width":6,"y":0,"x":0,"type":"metric","properties":{"view":"timeSeries","stacked":false,"metrics":[["Namespace","CPUUtilization","Environment","Prod","Type","App"]],"region":"us-east-1"}}]}'
```

Output:

```
{
    "DashboardValidationMessages": []
}
```

For more information, see [Creating a CloudWatch dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create_dashboard.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

## Output

DashboardValidationMessages -> (list)

If the input for `PutDashboard` was correct and the dashboard was successfully created or modified, this result is empty.

If this result includes only warning messages, then the input was valid enough for the dashboard to be created or modified, but some elements of the dashboard might not render.

If this result includes error messages, the input was not valid and the operation failed.

(structure)

An error or warning for the operation.

DataPath -> (string)

The data path related to the message.

Message -> (string)

A message describing the error or warning.
