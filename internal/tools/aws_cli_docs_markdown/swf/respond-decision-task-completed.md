# respond-decision-task-completed

## Description

Used by deciders to tell the service that the  DecisionTask identified by the `taskToken` has successfully completed. The `decisions` argument specifies the list of decisions made while processing the task.

A `DecisionTaskCompleted` event is added to the workflow history. The `executionContext` specified is attached to the event in the workflow execution history.

**Access Control**

If an IAM policy grants permission to use `RespondDecisionTaskCompleted` , it can express permissions for the list of decisions in the `decisions` parameter. Each of the decisions has one or more parameters, much like a regular API call. To allow for policies to be as readable as possible, you can express permissions on decisions as if they were actual API calls, including applying conditions to some parameters. For more information, see [Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html) in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide* .

## Options

`--task-token` (string)

The `taskToken` from the  DecisionTask .

### Warning

`taskToken` is generated by the service and should be treated as an opaque value. If the task is passed to another process, its `taskToken` must also be passed. This enables it to provide its progress and respond with results.

`--decisions` (list)

The list of decisions (possibly empty) made by the decider while processing this decision task. See the docs for the  Decision structure for details.

(structure)

Specifies a decision made by the decider. A decision can be one of these types:

- `CancelTimer` â Cancels a previously started timer and records a `TimerCanceled` event in the history.
- `CancelWorkflowExecution` â Closes the workflow execution and records a `WorkflowExecutionCanceled` event in the history.
- `CompleteWorkflowExecution` â Closes the workflow execution and records a `WorkflowExecutionCompleted` event in the history .
- `ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution` â Closes the workflow execution and starts a new workflow execution of the same type using the same workflow ID and a unique run Id. A `WorkflowExecutionContinuedAsNew` event is recorded in the history.
- `FailWorkflowExecution` â Closes the workflow execution and records a `WorkflowExecutionFailed` event in the history.
- `RecordMarker` â Records a `MarkerRecorded` event in the history. Markers can be used for adding custom information in the history for instance to let deciders know that they donât need to look at the history beyond the marker event.
- `RequestCancelActivityTask` â Attempts to cancel a previously scheduled activity task. If the activity task was scheduled but has not been assigned to a worker, then it is canceled. If the activity task was already assigned to a worker, then the worker is informed that cancellation has been requested in the response to  RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat .
- `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution` â Requests that a request be made to cancel the specified external workflow execution and records a `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated` event in the history.
- `ScheduleActivityTask` â Schedules an activity task.
- `SignalExternalWorkflowExecution` â Requests a signal to be delivered to the specified external workflow execution and records a `SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated` event in the history.
- `StartChildWorkflowExecution` â Requests that a child workflow execution be started and records a `StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated` event in the history. The child workflow execution is a separate workflow execution with its own history.
- `StartTimer` â Starts a timer for this workflow execution and records a `TimerStarted` event in the history. This timer fires after the specified delay and record a `TimerFired` event.

**Access Control**

If you grant permission to use `RespondDecisionTaskCompleted` , you can use IAM policies to express permissions for the list of decisions returned by this action as if they were members of the API. Treating decisions as a pseudo API maintains a uniform conceptual model and helps keep policies readable. For details and example IAM policies, see [Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html) in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide* .

**Decision Failure**

Decisions can fail for several reasons

- The ordering of decisions should follow a logical flow. Some decisions might not make sense in the current context of the workflow execution and therefore fails.
- A limit on your account was reached.
- The decision lacks sufficient permissions.

One of the following events might be added to the history to indicate an error. The event attributeâs `cause` parameter indicates the cause. If `cause` is set to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED` , the decision failed because it lacked sufficient permissions. For details and example IAM policies, see [Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html) in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide* .

- `ScheduleActivityTaskFailed` â A `ScheduleActivityTask` decision failed. This could happen if the activity type specified in the decision isnât registered, is in a deprecated state, or the decision isnât properly configured.
- `RequestCancelActivityTaskFailed` â A `RequestCancelActivityTask` decision failed. This could happen if there is no open activity task with the specified activityId.
- `StartTimerFailed` â A `StartTimer` decision failed. This could happen if there is another open timer with the same timerId.
- `CancelTimerFailed` â A `CancelTimer` decision failed. This could happen if there is no open timer with the specified timerId.
- `StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed` â A `StartChildWorkflowExecution` decision failed. This could happen if the workflow type specified isnât registered, is deprecated, or the decision isnât properly configured.
- `SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed` â A `SignalExternalWorkflowExecution` decision failed. This could happen if the `workflowID` specified in the decision was incorrect.
- `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed` â A `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution` decision failed. This could happen if the `workflowID` specified in the decision was incorrect.
- `CancelWorkflowExecutionFailed` â A `CancelWorkflowExecution` decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution.
- `CompleteWorkflowExecutionFailed` â A `CompleteWorkflowExecution` decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution.
- `ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionFailed` â A `ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution` decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution or the ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution decision was not configured correctly.
- `FailWorkflowExecutionFailed` â A `FailWorkflowExecution` decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution.

The preceding error events might occur due to an error in the decider logic, which might put the workflow execution in an unstable state The cause field in the event structure for the error event indicates the cause of the error.

### Note

A workflow execution may be closed by the decider by returning one of the following decisions when completing a decision task: `CompleteWorkflowExecution` , `FailWorkflowExecution` , `CancelWorkflowExecution` and `ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution` . An `UnhandledDecision` fault is returned if a workflow closing decision is specified and a signal or activity event had been added to the history while the decision task was being performed by the decider. Unlike the above situations which are logic issues, this fault is always possible because of race conditions in a distributed system. The right action here is to call  RespondDecisionTaskCompleted without any decisions. This would result in another decision task with these new events included in the history. The decider should handle the new events and may decide to close the workflow execution.

`--execution-context` (string)

User defined context to add to workflow execution.

`--task-list` (structure)

The task list to use for the future decision tasks of this workflow execution. This list overrides the original task list you specified while starting the workflow execution.

name -> (string)

The name of the task list.

Shorthand Syntax:

```
name=string
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{
  "name": "string"
}
```

`--task-list-schedule-to-start-timeout` (string)

Specifies a timeout (in seconds) for the task list override. When this parameter is missing, the task list override is permanent. This parameter makes it possible to temporarily override the task list. If a decision task scheduled on the override task list is not started within the timeout, the decision task will time out. Amazon SWF will revert the override and schedule a new decision task to the original task list.

If a decision task scheduled on the override task list is started within the timeout, but not completed within the start-to-close timeout, Amazon SWF will also revert the override and schedule a new decision task to the original task list.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

None
