# describe-listener

## Description

Describe a listener.

```

## Options

`--listener-arn` (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener to describe.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To describe a listener**

The following `describe-listener` example describes a listener.

```
aws globalaccelerator describe-listener \
    --listener-arn arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/abcdef1234
```

Output:

```
{
    "Listener": {
        "ListenerArn": "arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/abcdef1234",
        "PortRanges": [
            {
                "FromPort": 80,
                "ToPort": 80
            }
        ],
        "Protocol": "TCP",
        "ClientAffinity": "NONE"
    }
}
```

## Output

Listener -> (structure)

The description of a listener.

ListenerArn -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.

PortRanges -> (list)

The list of port ranges for the connections from clients to the accelerator.

(structure)

A complex type for a range of ports for a listener.

FromPort -> (integer)

The first port in the range of ports, inclusive.

ToPort -> (integer)

The last port in the range of ports, inclusive.

Protocol -> (string)

The protocol for the connections from clients to the accelerator.

ClientAffinity -> (string)

Client affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the same endpoint, if you have stateful applications, regardless of the port and protocol of the client request. Client affinity gives you control over whether to always route each client to the same specific endpoint.

Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity is `NONE` , Global Accelerator uses the âfive-tupleâ (5-tuple) propertiesâsource IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocolâto select the hash value, and then chooses the best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses different ports to connect to Global Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to the same endpoint because the hash value changes.

If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client affinity to `SOURCE_IP` instead. When you use the `SOURCE_IP` setting, Global Accelerator uses the âtwo-tupleâ (2-tuple) propertiesâ source (client) IP address and destination IP addressâto select the hash value.

The default value is `NONE` .
