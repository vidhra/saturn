# put-file-system-policy

## Description

Applies an Amazon EFS `FileSystemPolicy` to an Amazon EFS file system. A file system policy is an IAM resource-based policy and can contain multiple policy statements. A file system always has exactly one file system policy, which can be the default policy or an explicit policy set or updated using this API operation. EFS file system policies have a 20,000 character limit. When an explicit policy is set, it overrides the default policy. For more information about the default file system policy, see [Default EFS file system policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/iam-access-control-nfs-efs.html#default-filesystempolicy) .

### Note

EFS file system policies have a 20,000 character limit.

This operation requires permissions for the `elasticfilesystem:PutFileSystemPolicy` action.

## Options

`--file-system-id` (string)

The ID of the EFS file system that you want to create or update the `FileSystemPolicy` for.

`--policy` (string)

The `FileSystemPolicy` that youâre creating. Accepts a JSON formatted policy definition. EFS file system policies have a 20,000 character limit. To find out more about the elements that make up a file system policy, see [Resource-based policies within Amazon EFS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-resource-based-policies) .

`--bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check` | `--no-bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check` (boolean)

(Optional) A boolean that specifies whether or not to bypass the `FileSystemPolicy` lockout safety check. The lockout safety check determines whether the policy in the request will lock out, or prevent, the IAM principal that is making the request from making future `PutFileSystemPolicy` requests on this file system. Set `BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck` to `True` only when you intend to prevent the IAM principal that is making the request from making subsequent `PutFileSystemPolicy` requests on this file system. The default value is `False` .

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

FileSystemId -> (string)

Specifies the EFS file system to which the `FileSystemPolicy` applies.

Policy -> (string)

The JSON formatted `FileSystemPolicy` for the EFS file system.
