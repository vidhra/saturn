## Options

`--rest-api-id` (string)

The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

`--request-validator-id` (string)

The identifier of RequestValidator to be updated.

`--patch-operations` (list)

For more information about supported patch operations, see [Patch Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/patch-operations.html) .

(structure)

For more information about supported patch operations, see [Patch Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/patch-operations.html) .

op -> (string)

An update operation to be performed with this PATCH request. The valid value can be add, remove, replace or copy. Not all valid operations are supported for a given resource. Support of the operations depends on specific operational contexts. Attempts to apply an unsupported operation on a resource will return an error message..

path -> (string)

The op operationâs target, as identified by a JSON Pointer value that references a location within the targeted resource. For example, if the target resource has an updateable property of {ânameâ:âvalueâ}, the path for this property is /name. If the name property value is a JSON object (e.g., {ânameâ: {âchild/nameâ: âchild-valueâ}}), the path for the child/name property will be /name/child~1name. Any slash (â/â) character appearing in path names must be escaped with â~1â, as shown in the example above. Each op operation can have only one path associated with it.

value -> (string)

The new target value of the update operation. It is applicable for the add or replace operation. When using AWS CLI to update a property of a JSON value, enclose the JSON object with a pair of single quotes in a Linux shell, e.g., â{âaâ: â¦}â.

from -> (string)

The copy update operationâs source as identified by a JSON-Pointer value referencing the location within the targeted resource to copy the value from. For example, to promote a canary deployment, you copy the canary deployment ID to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on a Stage resource with âopâ:âcopyâ, âfromâ:â/canarySettings/deploymentIdâ and âpathâ:â/deploymentIdâ.

Shorthand Syntax:

```
op=string,path=string,value=string,from=string ...
```

JSON Syntax:

```
[
  {
    "op": "add"|"remove"|"replace"|"move"|"copy"|"test",
    "path": "string",
    "value": "string",
    "from": "string"
  }
  ...
]
```

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

id -> (string)

name -> (string)

validateRequestBody -> (boolean)

A Boolean flag to indicate whether to validate a request body according to the configured Model schema.

validateRequestParameters -> (boolean)

A Boolean flag to indicate whether to validate request parameters (`true` ) or not (`false` ).
