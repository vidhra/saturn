# get-authorizers

## Description

Describe an existing Authorizers resource.

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/apigateway-2015-07-09/GetAuthorizers)

`get-authorizers` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the `--no-paginate` argument.
When using `--output text` and the `--query` argument on a paginated response, the `--query` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: `items`

```

## Options

`--rest-api-id` (string)

The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--starting-token` (string)

A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the `NextToken` from a previously truncated response.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--page-size` (integer)

The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the commandâs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--max-items` (integer)

The total number of items to return in the commandâs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a `NextToken` is provided in the commandâs output. To resume pagination, provide the `NextToken` value in the `starting-token` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the `NextToken` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To get the list of authorizers for a REST API**

Command:

```
aws apigateway get-authorizers --rest-api-id 1234123412
```

Output:

```
{
    "items": [
        {
            "name": "MyAuthorizer",
            "authorizerUri": "arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123412341234:function:My_Authorizer_Function/invocations",
            "authorizerResultTtlInSeconds": 300,
            "identitySource": "method.request.header.Authorization",
            "type": "TOKEN",
            "id": "gfi4n3"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Output

position -> (string)

items -> (list)

The current page of elements from this collection.

(structure)

Represents an authorization layer for methods. If enabled on a method, API Gateway will activate the authorizer when a client calls the method.

id -> (string)

The identifier for the authorizer resource.

name -> (string)

The name of the authorizer.

type -> (string)

The authorizer type. Valid values are `TOKEN` for a Lambda function using a single authorization token submitted in a custom header, `REQUEST` for a Lambda function using incoming request parameters, and `COGNITO_USER_POOLS` for using an Amazon Cognito user pool.

providerARNs -> (list)

A list of the Amazon Cognito user pool ARNs for the `COGNITO_USER_POOLS` authorizer. Each element is of this format: `arn:aws:cognito-idp:{region}:{account_id}:userpool/{user_pool_id}` . For a `TOKEN` or `REQUEST` authorizer, this is not defined.

(string)

authType -> (string)

Optional customer-defined field, used in OpenAPI imports and exports without functional impact.

authorizerUri -> (string)

Specifies the authorizerâs Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). For `TOKEN` or `REQUEST` authorizers, this must be a well-formed Lambda function URI, for example, `arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:{account_id}:function:{lambda_function_name}/invocations` . In general, the URI has this form `arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:lambda:path/{service_api}` , where `{region}` is the same as the region hosting the Lambda function, `path` indicates that the remaining substring in the URI should be treated as the path to the resource, including the initial `/` . For Lambda functions, this is usually of the form `/2015-03-31/functions/[FunctionARN]/invocations` .

authorizerCredentials -> (string)

Specifies the required credentials as an IAM role for API Gateway to invoke the authorizer. To specify an IAM role for API Gateway to assume, use the roleâs Amazon Resource Name (ARN). To use resource-based permissions on the Lambda function, specify null.

identitySource -> (string)

The identity source for which authorization is requested. For a `TOKEN` or `COGNITO_USER_POOLS` authorizer, this is required and specifies the request header mapping expression for the custom header holding the authorization token submitted by the client. For example, if the token header name is `Auth` , the header mapping expression is `method.request.header.Auth` . For the `REQUEST` authorizer, this is required when authorization caching is enabled. The value is a comma-separated string of one or more mapping expressions of the specified request parameters. For example, if an `Auth` header, a `Name` query string parameter are defined as identity sources, this value is `method.request.header.Auth` , `method.request.querystring.Name` . These parameters will be used to derive the authorization caching key and to perform runtime validation of the `REQUEST` authorizer by verifying all of the identity-related request parameters are present, not null and non-empty. Only when this is true does the authorizer invoke the authorizer Lambda function, otherwise, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response without calling the Lambda function. The valid value is a string of comma-separated mapping expressions of the specified request parameters. When the authorization caching is not enabled, this property is optional.

identityValidationExpression -> (string)

A validation expression for the incoming identity token. For `TOKEN` authorizers, this value is a regular expression. For `COGNITO_USER_POOLS` authorizers, API Gateway will match the `aud` field of the incoming token from the client against the specified regular expression. It will invoke the authorizerâs Lambda function when there is a match. Otherwise, it will return a 401 Unauthorized response without calling the Lambda function. The validation expression does not apply to the `REQUEST` authorizer.

authorizerResultTtlInSeconds -> (integer)

The TTL in seconds of cached authorizer results. If it equals 0, authorization caching is disabled. If it is greater than 0, API Gateway will cache authorizer responses. If this field is not set, the default value is 300. The maximum value is 3600, or 1 hour.
