# modify-route-server

## Description

Modifies the configuration of an existing route server.

Amazon VPC Route Server simplifies routing for traffic between workloads that are deployed within a VPC and its internet gateways. With this feature, VPC Route Server dynamically updates VPC and internet gateway route tables with your preferred IPv4 or IPv6 routes to achieve routing fault tolerance for those workloads. This enables you to automatically reroute traffic within a VPC, which increases the manageability of VPC routing and interoperability with third-party workloads.

Route server supports the follow route table types:

- VPC route tables not associated with subnets
- Subnet route tables
- Internet gateway route tables

Route server does not support route tables associated with virtual private gateways. To propagate routes into a transit gateway route table, use [Transit Gateway Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-connect.html) .

For more information see [Dynamic routing in your VPC with VPC Route Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/dynamic-routing-route-server.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide* .

## Options

`--route-server-id` (string)

The ID of the route server to modify.

`--persist-routes` (string)

Specifies whether to persist routes after all BGP sessions are terminated.

- enable: Routes will be persisted in FIB and RIB after all BGP sessions are terminated.
- disable: Routes will not be persisted in FIB and RIB after all BGP sessions are terminated.
- reset: If a route server has persisted routes due to all BGP sessions having ended, reset will withdraw all routes and reset route server to an empty FIB and RIB.

Possible values:

- `enable`
- `disable`
- `reset`

`--persist-routes-duration` (long)

The number of minutes a route server will wait after BGP is re-established to unpersist the routes in the FIB and RIB. Value must be in the range of 1-5. Required if PersistRoutes is `enabled` .

If you set the duration to 1 minute, then when your network appliance re-establishes BGP with route server, it has 1 minute to relearn itâs adjacent network and advertise those routes to route server before route server resumes normal functionality. In most cases, 1 minute is probably sufficient. If, however, you have concerns that your BGP network may not be capable of fully re-establishing and re-learning everything in 1 minute, you can increase the duration up to 5 minutes.

`--sns-notifications-enabled` | `--no-sns-notifications-enabled` (boolean)

Specifies whether to enable SNS notifications for route server events. Enabling SNS notifications persists BGP status changes to an SNS topic provisioned by Amazon Web Services.

`--dry-run` | `--no-dry-run` (boolean)

A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action without actually making the request and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation` . Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation` .

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

Information about the modified route server.

RouteServerId -> (string)

The unique identifier of the route server.

AmazonSideAsn -> (long)

The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the appliance. Valid values are from 1 to 4294967295. We recommend using a private ASN in the 64512â65534 (16-bit ASN) or 4200000000â4294967294 (32-bit ASN) range.

State -> (string)

The current state of the route server.

Tags -> (list)

Any tags assigned to the route server.

(structure)

Describes a tag.

Key -> (string)

The key of the tag.

Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with `aws:` .

Value -> (string)

The value of the tag.

Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

PersistRoutesState -> (string)

The current state of route persistence for the route server.

PersistRoutesDuration -> (long)

The number of minutes a route server will wait after BGP is re-established to unpersist the routes in the FIB and RIB. Value must be in the range of 1-5. The default value is 1. Only valid if `persistRoutesState` is âenabledâ.

If you set the duration to 1 minute, then when your network appliance re-establishes BGP with route server, it has 1 minute to relearn itâs adjacent network and advertise those routes to route server before route server resumes normal functionality. In most cases, 1 minute is probably sufficient. If, however, you have concerns that your BGP network may not be capable of fully re-establishing and re-learning everything in 1 minute, you can increase the duration up to 5 minutes.

SnsNotificationsEnabled -> (boolean)

Indicates whether SNS notifications are enabled for the route server. Enabling SNS notifications persists BGP status changes to an SNS topic provisioned by Amazon Web Services.

SnsTopicArn -> (string)

The ARN of the SNS topic where notifications are published.
