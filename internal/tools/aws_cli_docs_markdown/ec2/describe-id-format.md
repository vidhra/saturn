# describe-id-format

## Description

Describes the ID format settings for your resources on a per-Region basis, for example, to view which resource types are enabled for longer IDs. This request only returns information about resource types whose ID formats can be modified; it does not return information about other resource types.

The following resource types support longer IDs: `bundle` | `conversion-task` | `customer-gateway` | `dhcp-options` | `elastic-ip-allocation` | `elastic-ip-association` | `export-task` | `flow-log` | `image` | `import-task` | `instance` | `internet-gateway` | `network-acl` | `network-acl-association` | `network-interface` | `network-interface-attachment` | `prefix-list` | `reservation` | `route-table` | `route-table-association` | `security-group` | `snapshot` | `subnet` | `subnet-cidr-block-association` | `volume` | `vpc` | `vpc-cidr-block-association` | `vpc-endpoint` | `vpc-peering-connection` | `vpn-connection` | `vpn-gateway` .

These settings apply to the IAM user who makes the request; they do not apply to the entire Amazon Web Services account. By default, an IAM user defaults to the same settings as the root user, unless they explicitly override the settings by running the  ModifyIdFormat command. Resources created with longer IDs are visible to all IAM users, regardless of these settings and provided that they have permission to use the relevant `Describe` command for the resource type.

## Options

`--resource` (string)

The type of resource: `bundle` | `conversion-task` | `customer-gateway` | `dhcp-options` | `elastic-ip-allocation` | `elastic-ip-association` | `export-task` | `flow-log` | `image` | `import-task` | `instance` | `internet-gateway` | `network-acl` | `network-acl-association` | `network-interface` | `network-interface-attachment` | `prefix-list` | `reservation` | `route-table` | `route-table-association` | `security-group` | `snapshot` | `subnet` | `subnet-cidr-block-association` | `volume` | `vpc` | `vpc-cidr-block-association` | `vpc-endpoint` | `vpc-peering-connection` | `vpn-connection` | `vpn-gateway`

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**Example 1: To describe the ID format of a resource**

The following `describe-id-format` example describes the ID format for security groups.

```
aws ec2 describe-id-format \
    --resource security-group
```

In the following example output, the `Deadline` value indicates that the deadline for this resource type to permanently switch from the short ID format to the long ID format expired at 00:00 UTC on August 15, 2018.

```
{
    "Statuses": [
        {
            "Deadline": "2018-08-15T00:00:00.000Z",
            "Resource": "security-group",
            "UseLongIds": true
        }
    ]
}
```

**Example 2: To describe the ID format for all resources**

The following `describe-id-format` example describes the ID format for all resource types. All resource types that supported the short ID format were switched to use the long ID format.

```
aws ec2 describe-id-format
```

## Output

Statuses -> (list)

Information about the ID format for the resource.

(structure)

Describes the ID format for a resource.

Deadline -> (timestamp)

The date in UTC at which you are permanently switched over to using longer IDs. If a deadline is not yet available for this resource type, this field is not returned.

Resource -> (string)

The type of resource.

UseLongIds -> (boolean)

Indicates whether longer IDs (17-character IDs) are enabled for the resource.
