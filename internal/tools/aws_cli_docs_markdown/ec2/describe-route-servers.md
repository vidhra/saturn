# describe-route-servers

## Description

Describes one or more route servers.

Amazon VPC Route Server simplifies routing for traffic between workloads that are deployed within a VPC and its internet gateways. With this feature, VPC Route Server dynamically updates VPC and internet gateway route tables with your preferred IPv4 or IPv6 routes to achieve routing fault tolerance for those workloads. This enables you to automatically reroute traffic within a VPC, which increases the manageability of VPC routing and interoperability with third-party workloads.

Route server supports the follow route table types:

- VPC route tables not associated with subnets
- Subnet route tables
- Internet gateway route tables

Route server does not support route tables associated with virtual private gateways. To propagate routes into a transit gateway route table, use [Transit Gateway Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-connect.html) .

For more information see [Dynamic routing in your VPC with VPC Route Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/dynamic-routing-route-server.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide* .

`describe-route-servers` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the `--no-paginate` argument.
When using `--output text` and the `--query` argument on a paginated response, the `--query` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: `RouteServers`

## Options

`--route-server-ids` (list)

The IDs of the route servers to describe.

(string)

Syntax:

```
"string" "string" ...
```

`--filters` (list)

One or more filters to apply to the describe request.

(structure)

A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an `AND` , and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

For more information, see [List and filter using the CLI and API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide* .

Name -> (string)

The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

Values -> (list)

The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an `OR` , and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

(string)

Shorthand Syntax:

```
Name=string,Values=string,string ...
```

JSON Syntax:

```
[
  {
    "Name": "string",
    "Values": ["string", ...]
  }
  ...
]
```

`--dry-run` | `--no-dry-run` (boolean)

A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action without actually making the request and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation` . Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation` .

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--starting-token` (string)

A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the `NextToken` from a previously truncated response.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--page-size` (integer)

The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the commandâs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--max-items` (integer)

The total number of items to return in the commandâs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a `NextToken` is provided in the commandâs output. To resume pagination, provide the `NextToken` value in the `starting-token` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the `NextToken` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

RouteServers -> (list)

Information about the described route servers.

(structure)

Describes a route server and its configuration.

Amazon VPC Route Server simplifies routing for traffic between workloads that are deployed within a VPC and its internet gateways. With this feature, VPC Route Server dynamically updates VPC and internet gateway route tables with your preferred IPv4 or IPv6 routes to achieve routing fault tolerance for those workloads. This enables you to automatically reroute traffic within a VPC, which increases the manageability of VPC routing and interoperability with third-party workloads.

Route server supports the follow route table types:

- VPC route tables not associated with subnets
- Subnet route tables
- Internet gateway route tables

Route server does not support route tables associated with virtual private gateways. To propagate routes into a transit gateway route table, use [Transit Gateway Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-connect.html) .

RouteServerId -> (string)

The unique identifier of the route server.

AmazonSideAsn -> (long)

The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the appliance. Valid values are from 1 to 4294967295. We recommend using a private ASN in the 64512â65534 (16-bit ASN) or 4200000000â4294967294 (32-bit ASN) range.

State -> (string)

The current state of the route server.

Tags -> (list)

Any tags assigned to the route server.

(structure)

Describes a tag.

Key -> (string)

The key of the tag.

Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with `aws:` .

Value -> (string)

The value of the tag.

Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

PersistRoutesState -> (string)

The current state of route persistence for the route server.

PersistRoutesDuration -> (long)

The number of minutes a route server will wait after BGP is re-established to unpersist the routes in the FIB and RIB. Value must be in the range of 1-5. The default value is 1. Only valid if `persistRoutesState` is âenabledâ.

If you set the duration to 1 minute, then when your network appliance re-establishes BGP with route server, it has 1 minute to relearn itâs adjacent network and advertise those routes to route server before route server resumes normal functionality. In most cases, 1 minute is probably sufficient. If, however, you have concerns that your BGP network may not be capable of fully re-establishing and re-learning everything in 1 minute, you can increase the duration up to 5 minutes.

SnsNotificationsEnabled -> (boolean)

Indicates whether SNS notifications are enabled for the route server. Enabling SNS notifications persists BGP status changes to an SNS topic provisioned by Amazon Web Services.

SnsTopicArn -> (string)

The ARN of the SNS topic where notifications are published.

NextToken -> (string)

The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is `null` when there are no more results to return.
