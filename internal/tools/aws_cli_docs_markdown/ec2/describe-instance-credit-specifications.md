# describe-instance-credit-specifications

## Description

Describes the credit option for CPU usage of the specified burstable performance instances. The credit options are `standard` and `unlimited` .

If you do not specify an instance ID, Amazon EC2 returns burstable performance instances with the `unlimited` credit option, as well as instances that were previously configured as T2, T3, and T3a with the `unlimited` credit option. For example, if you resize a T2 instance, while it is configured as `unlimited` , to an M4 instance, Amazon EC2 returns the M4 instance.

If you specify one or more instance IDs, Amazon EC2 returns the credit option (`standard` or `unlimited` ) of those instances. If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, such as an instance that is not a burstable performance instance, an error is returned.

Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is usually less than one hour.

If an Availability Zone is experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you specify only instance IDs in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.

For more information, see [Burstable performance instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide* .

`describe-instance-credit-specifications` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the `--no-paginate` argument.
When using `--output text` and the `--query` argument on a paginated response, the `--query` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: `InstanceCreditSpecifications`

## Options

`--dry-run` | `--no-dry-run` (boolean)

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the operation, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation` . Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation` .

`--filters` (list)

The filters.

- `instance-id` - The ID of the instance.

(structure)

A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an `AND` , and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

For more information, see [List and filter using the CLI and API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide* .

Name -> (string)

The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

Values -> (list)

The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an `OR` , and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

(string)

Shorthand Syntax:

```
Name=string,Values=string,string ...
```

JSON Syntax:

```
[
  {
    "Name": "string",
    "Values": ["string", ...]
  }
  ...
]
```

`--instance-ids` (list)

The instance IDs.

Default: Describes all your instances.

Constraints: Maximum 1000 explicitly specified instance IDs.

(string)

Syntax:

```
"string" "string" ...
```

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--starting-token` (string)

A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the `NextToken` from a previously truncated response.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--page-size` (integer)

The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the commandâs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--max-items` (integer)

The total number of items to return in the commandâs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a `NextToken` is provided in the commandâs output. To resume pagination, provide the `NextToken` value in the `starting-token` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the `NextToken` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To describe the credit option for CPU usage of one or more instances**

The following `describe-instance-credit-specifications` example describes the CPU credit option for the specified instance.

```
aws ec2 describe-instance-credit-specifications \
    --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0
```

Output:

```
{
    "InstanceCreditSpecifications": [
        {
            "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
            "CpuCredits": "unlimited"
        }
    ]
}
```
