# put-bucket-versioning

## Description

### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

### Note

When you enable versioning on a bucket for the first time, it might take a short amount of time for the change to be fully propagated. While this change is propagating, you might encounter intermittent `HTTP 404 NoSuchKey` errors for requests to objects created or updated after enabling versioning. We recommend that you wait for 15 minutes after enabling versioning before issuing write operations (`PUT` or `DELETE` ) on objects in the bucket.

Sets the versioning state of an existing bucket.

You can set the versioning state with one of the following values:

**Enabled** âEnables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.

**Suspended** âDisables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null.

If the versioning state has never been set on a bucket, it has no versioning state; a [GetBucketVersioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html) request does not return a versioning state value.

In order to enable MFA Delete, you must be the bucket owner. If you are the bucket owner and want to enable MFA Delete in the bucket versioning configuration, you must include the `x-amz-mfa request` header and the `Status` and the `MfaDelete` request elements in a request to set the versioning state of the bucket.

### Warning

If you have an object expiration lifecycle configuration in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle configuration will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in the version-enabled bucket. (A version-enabled bucket maintains one current and zero or more noncurrent object versions.) For more information, see [Lifecycle and Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html#lifecycle-and-other-bucket-config) .

```

## Options

`--bucket` (string)

The bucket name.

`--content-md5` (string)

>The Base64 encoded 128-bit `MD5` digest of the data. You must use this header as a message integrity check to verify that the request body was not corrupted in transit. For more information, see [RFC 1864](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1864.txt) .

For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated automatically.

`--checksum-algorithm` (string)

Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the request when you use the SDK. This header will not provide any additional functionality if you donât use the SDK. When you send this header, there must be a corresponding `x-amz-checksum` or `x-amz-trailer` header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code `400 Bad Request` . For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided `ChecksumAlgorithm` parameter.

Possible values:

- `CRC32`
- `CRC32C`
- `SHA1`
- `SHA256`
- `CRC64NVME`

`--mfa` (string)

The concatenation of the authentication deviceâs serial number, a space, and the value that is displayed on your authentication device.

`--versioning-configuration` (structure)

Container for setting the versioning state.

MFADelete -> (string)

Specifies whether MFA delete is enabled in the bucket versioning configuration. This element is only returned if the bucket has been configured with MFA delete. If the bucket has never been so configured, this element is not returned.

Status -> (string)

The versioning state of the bucket.

Shorthand Syntax:

```
MFADelete=string,Status=string
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{
  "MFADelete": "Enabled"|"Disabled",
  "Status": "Enabled"|"Suspended"
}
```

`--expected-bucket-owner` (string)

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

The following command enables versioning on a bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`:

```
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```

The following command enables versioning, and uses an mfa code

```
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled --mfa "SERIAL 123456"
```

## Output

None
