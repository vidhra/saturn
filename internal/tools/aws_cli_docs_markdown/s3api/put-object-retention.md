# put-object-retention

## Description

### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Places an Object Retention configuration on an object. For more information, see [Locking Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html) . Users or accounts require the `s3:PutObjectRetention` permission in order to place an Object Retention configuration on objects. Bypassing a Governance Retention configuration requires the `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention` permission.

This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

## Options

`--bucket` (string)

The bucket name that contains the object you want to apply this Object Retention configuration to.

**Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName* -*AccountId* .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

`--key` (string)

The key name for the object that you want to apply this Object Retention configuration to.

`--retention` (structure)

The container element for the Object Retention configuration.

Mode -> (string)

Indicates the Retention mode for the specified object.

RetainUntilDate -> (timestamp)

The date on which this Object Lock Retention will expire.

Shorthand Syntax:

```
Mode=string,RetainUntilDate=timestamp
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{
  "Mode": "GOVERNANCE"|"COMPLIANCE",
  "RetainUntilDate": timestamp
}
```

`--request-payer` (string)

Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester Pays enabled, the requester will pay for corresponding charges to copy the object. For information about downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see [Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Possible values:

- `requester`

`--version-id` (string)

The version ID for the object that you want to apply this Object Retention configuration to.

`--bypass-governance-retention` | `--no-bypass-governance-retention` (boolean)

Indicates whether this action should bypass Governance-mode restrictions.

`--content-md5` (string)

The MD5 hash for the request body.

For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated automatically.

`--checksum-algorithm` (string)

Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when you use the SDK. This header will not provide any additional functionality if you donât use the SDK. When you send this header, there must be a corresponding `x-amz-checksum` or `x-amz-trailer` header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code `400 Bad Request` . For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided `ChecksumAlgorithm` parameter.

Possible values:

- `CRC32`
- `CRC32C`
- `SHA1`
- `SHA256`
- `CRC64NVME`

`--expected-bucket-owner` (string)

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To set an object retention configuration for an object**

The following `put-object-retention` example sets an object retention configuration for the specified object until 2025-01-01.

```
aws s3api put-object-retention \
    --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket-with-object-lock \
    --key doc1.rtf \
    --retention '{ "Mode": "GOVERNANCE", "RetainUntilDate": "2025-01-01T00:00:00" }'
```

This command produces no output.

## Output

RequestCharged -> (string)

If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
