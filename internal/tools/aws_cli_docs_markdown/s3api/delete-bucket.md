# delete-bucket

## Description

Deletes the S3 bucket. All objects (including all object versions and delete markers) in the bucket must be deleted before the bucket itself can be deleted.

### Note

- **Directory buckets** - If multipart uploads in a directory bucket are in progress, you canât delete the bucket until all the in-progress multipart uploads are aborted or completed.
- **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format [``](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/delete-bucket.html#id1)[https://s3express-control.*region-code*](https://s3express-control.*region-code*) .amazonaws.com/*bucket-name* `` . Virtual-hosted-style requests arenât supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

Permissions

- **General purpose bucket permissions** - You must have the `s3:DeleteBucket` permission on the specified bucket in a policy.
- **Directory bucket permissions** - You must have the `s3express:DeleteBucket` permission in an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isnât supported. This operation can only be performed by the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource. For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

HTTP Host header syntax

**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `s3express-control.*region-code* .amazonaws.com` .

The following operations are related to `DeleteBucket` :

- [CreateBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html)
- [DeleteObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObject.html)

## Options

`--bucket` (string)

Specifies the bucket being deleted.

**Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use path-style requests in the format `https://s3express-control.*region-code* .amazonaws.com/*bucket-name* `` . Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must also follow the format `` *bucket-base-name* --*zone-id* --x-s3` (for example, `` *DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET* â*usw2-az1* âx-s3`` ). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*

`--expected-bucket-owner` (string)

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

### Note

For directory buckets, this header is not supported in this API operation. If you specify this header, the request fails with the HTTP status code `501 Not Implemented` .

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

The following command deletes a bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`:

```
aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --region us-east-1
```

## Output

None
