# get-object-torrent

## Description

### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Returns torrent files from a bucket. BitTorrent can save you bandwidth when youâre distributing large files.

### Note

You can get torrent only for objects that are less than 5 GB in size, and that are not encrypted using server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key.

To use GET, you must have READ access to the object.

This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

The following action is related to `GetObjectTorrent` :

## Options

`--bucket` (string)

The name of the bucket containing the object for which to get the torrent files.

`--key` (string)

The object key for which to get the information.

`--request-payer` (string)

Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester Pays enabled, the requester will pay for corresponding charges to copy the object. For information about downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see [Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Possible values:

- `requester`

`--expected-bucket-owner` (string)

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

`outfile` (string)
Filename where the content will be saved

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

The following command creates a torrent for an object in a bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`:

```
aws s3api get-object-torrent --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --key large-video-file.mp4 large-video-file.torrent
```

The torrent file is saved locally in the current folder. Note that the output filename (`large-video-file.torrent`) is specified without an option name and must be the last argument in the command.

## Output

Body -> (streaming blob)

A Bencoded dictionary as defined by the BitTorrent specification

RequestCharged -> (string)

If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
