# put-object-lock-configuration

## Description

### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Places an Object Lock configuration on the specified bucket. The rule specified in the Object Lock configuration will be applied by default to every new object placed in the specified bucket. For more information, see [Locking Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html) .

### Note

- The `DefaultRetention` settings require both a mode and a period.
- The `DefaultRetention` period can be either `Days` or `Years` but you must select one. You cannot specify `Days` and `Years` at the same time.
- You can enable Object Lock for new or existing buckets. For more information, see [Configuring Object Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-configure.html) .

## Options

`--bucket` (string)

The bucket whose Object Lock configuration you want to create or replace.

`--object-lock-configuration` (structure)

The Object Lock configuration that you want to apply to the specified bucket.

ObjectLockEnabled -> (string)

Indicates whether this bucket has an Object Lock configuration enabled. Enable `ObjectLockEnabled` when you apply `ObjectLockConfiguration` to a bucket.

Rule -> (structure)

Specifies the Object Lock rule for the specified object. Enable the this rule when you apply `ObjectLockConfiguration` to a bucket. Bucket settings require both a mode and a period. The period can be either `Days` or `Years` but you must select one. You cannot specify `Days` and `Years` at the same time.

DefaultRetention -> (structure)

The default Object Lock retention mode and period that you want to apply to new objects placed in the specified bucket. Bucket settings require both a mode and a period. The period can be either `Days` or `Years` but you must select one. You cannot specify `Days` and `Years` at the same time.

Mode -> (string)

The default Object Lock retention mode you want to apply to new objects placed in the specified bucket. Must be used with either `Days` or `Years` .

Days -> (integer)

The number of days that you want to specify for the default retention period. Must be used with `Mode` .

Years -> (integer)

The number of years that you want to specify for the default retention period. Must be used with `Mode` .

Shorthand Syntax:

```
ObjectLockEnabled=string,Rule={DefaultRetention={Mode=string,Days=integer,Years=integer}}
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{
  "ObjectLockEnabled": "Enabled",
  "Rule": {
    "DefaultRetention": {
      "Mode": "GOVERNANCE"|"COMPLIANCE",
      "Days": integer,
      "Years": integer
    }
  }
}
```

`--request-payer` (string)

Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester Pays enabled, the requester will pay for corresponding charges to copy the object. For information about downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see [Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Possible values:

- `requester`

`--token` (string)

A token to allow Object Lock to be enabled for an existing bucket.

`--content-md5` (string)

The MD5 hash for the request body.

For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated automatically.

`--checksum-algorithm` (string)

Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when you use the SDK. This header will not provide any additional functionality if you donât use the SDK. When you send this header, there must be a corresponding `x-amz-checksum` or `x-amz-trailer` header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code `400 Bad Request` . For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided `ChecksumAlgorithm` parameter.

Possible values:

- `CRC32`
- `CRC32C`
- `SHA1`
- `SHA256`
- `CRC64NVME`

`--expected-bucket-owner` (string)

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To set an object lock configuration on a bucket**

The following `put-object-lock-configuration` example sets a 50-day object lock on the specified bucket.

```
aws s3api put-object-lock-configuration \
    --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket-with-object-lock \
    --object-lock-configuration '{ "ObjectLockEnabled": "Enabled", "Rule": { "DefaultRetention": { "Mode": "COMPLIANCE", "Days": 50 }}}'
```

This command produces no output.

## Output

RequestCharged -> (string)

If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
