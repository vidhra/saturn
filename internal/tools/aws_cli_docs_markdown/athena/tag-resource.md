# tag-resource

## Description

Adds one or more tags to an Athena resource. A tag is a label that you assign to a resource. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you can use tags to categorize Athena workgroups, data catalogs, or capacity reservations by purpose, owner, or environment. Use a consistent set of tag keys to make it easier to search and filter the resources in your account. For best practices, see [Tagging Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html) . Tag keys can be from 1 to 128 UTF-8 Unicode characters, and tag values can be from 0 to 256 UTF-8 Unicode characters. Tags can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @. Tag keys and values are case-sensitive. Tag keys must be unique per resource. If you specify more than one tag, separate them by commas.

## Options

`--resource-arn` (string)

Specifies the ARN of the Athena resource to which tags are to be added.

`--tags` (list)

A collection of one or more tags, separated by commas, to be added to an Athena resource.

(structure)

A label that you assign to a resource. Athena resources include workgroups, data catalogs, and capacity reservations. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you can use tags to categorize Athena resources by purpose, owner, or environment. Use a consistent set of tag keys to make it easier to search and filter the resources in your account. For best practices, see [Tagging Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html) . Tag keys can be from 1 to 128 UTF-8 Unicode characters, and tag values can be from 0 to 256 UTF-8 Unicode characters. Tags can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @. Tag keys and values are case-sensitive. Tag keys must be unique per resource. If you specify more than one tag, separate them by commas.

Key -> (string)

A tag key. The tag key length is from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8. You can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @. Tag keys are case-sensitive and must be unique per resource.

Value -> (string)

A tag value. The tag value length is from 0 to 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8. You can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @. Tag values are case-sensitive.

Shorthand Syntax:

```
Key=string,Value=string ...
```

JSON Syntax:

```
[
  {
    "Key": "string",
    "Value": "string"
  }
  ...
]
```

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To add a tag to a resource**

The following `tag-resource` example adds three tags to the `dynamo_db_catalog` data catalog.

```
aws athena tag-resource \
    --resource-arn arn:aws:athena:us-west-2:111122223333:datacatalog/dynamo_db_catalog \
    --tags Key=Organization,Value=Retail Key=Division,Value=Mountain Key=Product_Line,Value=Shoes Key=Location,Value=Denver
```

This command produces no output. To see the  result, use `aws athena list-tags-for-resource --resource-arn arn:aws:athena:us-west-2:111122223333:datacatalog/dynamo_db_catalog`.

For more information, see [Adding tags to a resource: tag-resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/tags-operations.html#tags-operations-examples-cli-tag-resource) in the *Amazon Athena User Guide*.
