# update-web-acl

## Description

Updates the specified  WebACL . While updating a web ACL, WAF provides continuous coverage to the resources that you have associated with the web ACL.

### Note

This operation completely replaces the mutable specifications that you already have for the web ACL with the ones that you provide to this call.

To modify a web ACL, do the following:

- Retrieve it by calling  GetWebACL
- Update its settings as needed
- Provide the complete web ACL specification to this call

A web ACL defines a collection of rules to use to inspect and control web requests. Each rule has a statement that defines what to look for in web requests and an action that WAF applies to requests that match the statement. In the web ACL, you assign a default action to take (allow, block) for any request that does not match any of the rules. The rules in a web ACL can be a combination of the types  Rule ,  RuleGroup , and managed rule group. You can associate a web ACL with one or more Amazon Web Services resources to protect. The resource types include Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner service, Amplify application, and Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.

**Temporary inconsistencies during updates**

When you create or change a web ACL or other WAF resources, the changes take a small amount of time to propagate to all areas where the resources are stored. The propagation time can be from a few seconds to a number of minutes.

The following are examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you might notice during change propagation:

- After you create a web ACL, if you try to associate it with a resource, you might get an exception indicating that the web ACL is unavailable.
- After you add a rule group to a web ACL, the new rule group rules might be in effect in one area where the web ACL is used and not in another.
- After you change a rule action setting, you might see the old action in some places and the new action in others.
- After you add an IP address to an IP set that is in use in a blocking rule, the new address might be blocked in one area while still allowed in another.

## Options

`--name` (string)

The name of the web ACL. You cannot change the name of a web ACL after you create it.

`--scope` (string)

Specifies whether this is for a global resource type, such as a Amazon CloudFront distribution. For an Amplify application, use `CLOUDFRONT` .

To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:

- CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: `--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1` .
- API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

Possible values:

- `CLOUDFRONT`
- `REGIONAL`

`--id` (string)

The unique identifier for the web ACL. This ID is returned in the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like update and delete.

`--default-action` (structure)

The action to perform if none of the `Rules` contained in the `WebACL` match.

Block -> (structure)

Specifies that WAF should block requests by default.

CustomResponse -> (structure)

Defines a custom response for the web request.

For information about customizing web requests and responses, see [Customizing web requests and responses in WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-custom-request-response.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

ResponseCode -> (integer)

The HTTP status code to return to the client.

For a list of status codes that you can use in your custom responses, see [Supported status codes for custom response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/customizing-the-response-status-codes.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)

References the response body that you want WAF to return to the web request client. You can define a custom response for a rule action or a default web ACL action that is set to block. To do this, you first define the response body key and value in the `CustomResponseBodies` setting for the  WebACL or  RuleGroup where you want to use it. Then, in the rule action or web ACL default action `BlockAction` setting, you reference the response body using this key.

ResponseHeaders -> (list)

The HTTP headers to use in the response. You can specify any header name except for `content-type` . Duplicate header names are not allowed.

For information about the limits on count and size for custom request and response settings, see [WAF quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/limits.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

(structure)

A custom header for custom request and response handling. This is used in  CustomResponse and  CustomRequestHandling .

Name -> (string)

The name of the custom header.

For custom request header insertion, when WAF inserts the header into the request, it prefixes this name `x-amzn-waf-` , to avoid confusion with the headers that are already in the request. For example, for the header name `sample` , WAF inserts the header `x-amzn-waf-sample` .

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

Allow -> (structure)

Specifies that WAF should allow requests by default.

CustomRequestHandling -> (structure)

Defines custom handling for the web request.

For information about customizing web requests and responses, see [Customizing web requests and responses in WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-custom-request-response.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

InsertHeaders -> (list)

The HTTP headers to insert into the request. Duplicate header names are not allowed.

For information about the limits on count and size for custom request and response settings, see [WAF quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/limits.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

(structure)

A custom header for custom request and response handling. This is used in  CustomResponse and  CustomRequestHandling .

Name -> (string)

The name of the custom header.

For custom request header insertion, when WAF inserts the header into the request, it prefixes this name `x-amzn-waf-` , to avoid confusion with the headers that are already in the request. For example, for the header name `sample` , WAF inserts the header `x-amzn-waf-sample` .

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

        }
        ...
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

`--description` (string)

A description of the web ACL that helps with identification.

`--rules` (list)

The  Rule statements used to identify the web requests that you want to manage. Each rule includes one top-level statement that WAF uses to identify matching web requests, and parameters that govern how WAF handles them.

(structure)

A single rule, which you can use in a  WebACL or  RuleGroup to identify web requests that you want to manage in some way. Each rule includes one top-level  Statement that WAF uses to identify matching web requests, and parameters that govern how WAF handles them.

Name -> (string)

The name of the rule.

If you change the name of a `Rule` after you create it and you want the ruleâs metric name to reflect the change, update the metric name in the ruleâs `VisibilityConfig` settings. WAF doesnât automatically update the metric name when you update the rule name.

Priority -> (integer)

If you define more than one `Rule` in a `WebACL` , WAF evaluates each request against the `Rules` in order based on the value of `Priority` . WAF processes rules with lower priority first. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Statement -> (structure)

The WAF processing statement for the rule, for example  ByteMatchStatement or  SizeConstraintStatement .

ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that defines a string match search for WAF to apply to web requests. The byte match statement provides the bytes to search for, the location in requests that you want WAF to search, and other settings. The bytes to search for are typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters. In the WAF console and the developer guide, this is called a string match statement.

SearchString -> (blob)

A string value that you want WAF to search for. WAF searches only in the part of web requests that you designate for inspection in  FieldToMatch . The maximum length of the value is 200 bytes.

Valid values depend on the component that you specify for inspection in `FieldToMatch` :

- `Method` : The HTTP method that you want WAF to search for. This indicates the type of operation specified in the request.
- `UriPath` : The value that you want WAF to search for in the URI path, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .
- `JA3Fingerprint` : Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .  You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .
- `HeaderOrder` : The list of header names to match for. WAF creates a string that contains the ordered list of header names, from the headers in the web request, and then matches against that string.

If `SearchString` includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.

**If youâre using the WAF API**

Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

For example, suppose the value of `Type` is `HEADER` and the value of `Data` is `User-Agent` . If you want to search the `User-Agent` header for the value `BadBot` , you base64-encode `BadBot` using MIME base64-encoding and include the resulting value, `QmFkQm90` , in the value of `SearchString` .

**If youâre using the CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs**

The value that you want WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available cookies normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

PositionalConstraint -> (string)

The area within the portion of the web request that you want WAF to search for `SearchString` . Valid values include the following:

**CONTAINS**

The specified part of the web request must include the value of `SearchString` , but the location doesnât matter.

**CONTAINS_WORD**

The specified part of the web request must include the value of `SearchString` , and `SearchString` must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _). In addition, `SearchString` must be a word, which means that both of the following are true:

- `SearchString` is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request or is preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_). Examples include the value of a header and `;BadBot` .
- `SearchString` is at the end of the specified part of the web request or is followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, `BadBot;` and `-BadBot;` .

**EXACTLY**

The value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of `SearchString` .

**STARTS_WITH**

The value of `SearchString` must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the web request.

**ENDS_WITH**

The value of `SearchString` must appear at the end of the specified part of the web request.

SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that inspects for malicious SQL code. Attackers insert malicious SQL code into web requests to do things like modify your database or extract data from it.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies.

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

SensitivityLevel -> (string)

The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to inspect for SQL injection attacks.

`HIGH` detects more attacks, but might generate more false positives, especially if your web requests frequently contain unusual strings. For information about identifying and mitigating false positives, see [Testing and tuning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-testing.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

`LOW` is generally a better choice for resources that already have other protections against SQL injection attacks or that have a low tolerance for false positives.

Default: `LOW`

XssMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that inspects for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. In XSS attacks, the attacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as a vehicle to inject malicious client-site scripts into other legitimate web browsers.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available cookies normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that compares a number of bytes against the size of a request component, using a comparison operator, such as greater than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can use a size constraint statement to look for query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

If you configure WAF to inspect the request body, WAF inspects only the number of bytes in the body up to the limit for the web ACL and protected resource type. If you know that the request body for your web requests should never exceed the inspection limit, you can use a size constraint statement to block requests that have a larger request body size. For more information about the inspection limits, see `Body` and `JsonBody` settings for the `FieldToMatch` data type.

If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI counts as one character. For example, the URI `/logo.jpg` is nine characters long.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object.

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

ComparisonOperator -> (string)

The operator to use to compare the request part to the size setting.

Size -> (long)

The size, in byte, to compare to the request part, after any transformations.

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that labels web requests by country and region and that matches against web requests based on country code. A geo match rule labels every request that it inspects regardless of whether it finds a match.

- To manage requests only by country, you can use this statement by itself and specify the countries that you want to match against in the `CountryCodes` array.
- Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with Count action so that it only labels requests. Then, add one or more label match rules to run after the geo match rule and configure them to match against the geographic labels and handle the requests as needed.

WAF labels requests using the alpha-2 country and region codes from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 standard. WAF determines the codes using either the IP address in the web request origin or, if you specify it, the address in the geo match `ForwardedIPConfig` .

If you use the web request origin, the label formats are `awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO region code>` and `awswaf:clientip:geo:country:<ISO country code>` .

If you use a forwarded IP address, the label formats are `awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO region code>` and `awswaf:forwardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code>` .

For additional details, see [Geographic match rule statement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-type-geo-match.html) in the [WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) .

CountryCodes -> (list)

An array of two-character country codes that you want to match against, for example, `[ "US", "CN" ]` , from the alpha-2 country ISO codes of the ISO 3166 international standard.

When you use a geo match statement just for the region and country labels that it adds to requests, you still have to supply a country code for the rule to evaluate. In this case, you configure the rule to only count matching requests, but it will still generate logging and count metrics for any matches. You can reduce the logging and metrics that the rule produces by specifying a country thatâs unlikely to be a source of traffic to your site.

(string)

ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to run the rules that are defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a rule group with your rules, then provide the ARN of the rule group in this statement.

You cannot nest a `RuleGroupReferenceStatement` , for example for use inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You cannot use a rule group reference statement inside another rule group. You can only reference a rule group as a top-level statement within a rule that you define in a web ACL.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

ExcludedRules -> (list)

Rules in the referenced rule group whose actions are set to `Count` .

### Note

Instead of this option, use `RuleActionOverrides` . It accepts any valid action setting, including `Count` .

(structure)

Specifies a single rule in a rule group whose action you want to override to `Count` .

### Note

Instead of this option, use `RuleActionOverrides` . It accepts any valid action setting, including `Count` .

The name of the rule whose action you want to override to `Count` .

RuleActionOverrides -> (list)

Action settings to use in the place of the rule actions that are configured inside the rule group. You specify one override for each rule whose action you want to change.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

You can use overrides for testing, for example you can override all of rule actions to `Count` and then monitor the resulting count metrics to understand how the rule group would handle your web traffic. You can also permanently override some or all actions, to modify how the rule group manages your web traffic.

(structure)

Action setting to use in the place of a rule action that is configured inside the rule group. You specify one override for each rule whose action you want to change.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

You can use overrides for testing, for example you can override all of rule actions to `Count` and then monitor the resulting count metrics to understand how the rule group would handle your web traffic. You can also permanently override some or all actions, to modify how the rule group manages your web traffic.

Name -> (string)

The name of the rule to override.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

For a list of status codes that you can use in your custom responses, see [Supported status codes for custom response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/customizing-the-response-status-codes.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)

References the response body that you want WAF to return to the web request client. You can define a custom response for a rule action or a default web ACL action that is set to block. To do this, you first define the response body key and value in the `CustomResponseBodies` setting for the  WebACL or  RuleGroup where you want to use it. Then, in the rule action or web ACL default action `BlockAction` setting, you reference the response body using this key.

ResponseHeaders -> (list)

The HTTP headers to use in the response. You can specify any header name except for `content-type` . Duplicate header names are not allowed.

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to detect web requests coming from particular IP addresses or address ranges. To use this, create an  IPSet that specifies the addresses you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this statement. To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

Each IP set rule statement references an IP set. You create and maintain the set independent of your rules. This allows you to use the single set in multiple rules. When you update the referenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules that reference it.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  IPSet that this statement references.

IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Position -> (string)

The position in the header to search for the IP address. The header can contain IP addresses of the original client and also of proxies. For example, the header value could be `10.1.1.1, 127.0.0.0, 10.10.10.10` where the first IP address identifies the original client and the rest identify proxies that the request went through.

The options for this setting are the following:

- FIRST - Inspect the first IP address in the list of IP addresses in the header. This is usually the clientâs original IP.
- LAST - Inspect the last IP address in the list of IP addresses in the header.
- ANY - Inspect all IP addresses in the header for a match. If the header contains more than 10 IP addresses, WAF inspects the last 10.

RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to search web request components for matches with regular expressions. To use this, create a  RegexPatternSet that specifies the expressions that you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this statement. A web request matches the pattern set rule statement if the request component matches any of the patterns in the set. To create a regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

Each regex pattern set rule statement references a regex pattern set. You create and maintain the set independent of your rules. This allows you to use the single set in multiple rules. When you update the referenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules that reference it.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  RegexPatternSet that this statement references.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies.

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

RateBasedStatement -> (structure)

A rate-based rule counts incoming requests and rate limits requests when they are coming at too fast a rate. The rule categorizes requests according to your aggregation criteria, collects them into aggregation instances, and counts and rate limits the requests for each instance.

### Note

If you change any of these settings in a rule thatâs currently in use, the change resets the ruleâs rate limiting counts. This can pause the ruleâs rate limiting activities for up to a minute.

You can specify individual aggregation keys, like IP address or HTTP method. You can also specify aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.

Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition.

For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP address and HTTP method values:

- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

The rule would create different aggregation instances according to your aggregation criteria, for example:

- If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each individual address is an aggregation instance, and WAF counts requests separately for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3
- IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1
- If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- HTTP method POST: count 2
- HTTP method GET: count 2
- If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2
- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1

For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which WAF counts and rate-limits individually.

You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.

You cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

For additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call `GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys` . This option is not available for other aggregation configurations.

WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF.

Limit -> (long)

The limit on requests during the specified evaluation window for a single aggregation instance for the rate-based rule. If the rate-based statement includes a `ScopeDownStatement` , this limit is applied only to the requests that match the statement.

Examples:

- If you aggregate on just the IP address, this is the limit on requests from any single IP address.
- If you aggregate on the HTTP method and the query argument name âcityâ, then this is the limit on requests for any single method, city pair.

EvaluationWindowSec -> (long)

The amount of time, in seconds, that WAF should include in its request counts, looking back from the current time. For example, for a setting of 120, when WAF checks the rate, it counts the requests for the 2 minutes immediately preceding the current time. Valid settings are 60, 120, 300, and 600.

This setting doesnât determine how often WAF checks the rate, but how far back it looks each time it checks. WAF checks the rate about every 10 seconds.

Default: `300` (5 minutes)

AggregateKeyType -> (string)

Setting that indicates how to aggregate the request counts.

### Note

Web requests that are missing any of the components specified in the aggregation keys are omitted from the rate-based rule evaluation and handling.

- `CONSTANT` - Count and limit the requests that match the rate-based ruleâs scope-down statement. With this option, the counted requests arenât further aggregated. The scope-down statement is the only specification used. When the count of all requests that satisfy the scope-down statement goes over the limit, WAF applies the rule action to all requests that satisfy the scope-down statement.  With this option, you must configure the `ScopeDownStatement` property.
- `CUSTOM_KEYS` - Aggregate the request counts using one or more web request components as the aggregate keys. With this option, you must specify the aggregate keys in the `CustomKeys` property.  To aggregate on only the IP address or only the forwarded IP address, donât use custom keys. Instead, set the aggregate key type to `IP` or `FORWARDED_IP` .
- `FORWARDED_IP` - Aggregate the request counts on the first IP address in an HTTP header.  With this option, you must specify the header to use in the `ForwardedIPConfig` property.  To aggregate on a combination of the forwarded IP address with other aggregate keys, use `CUSTOM_KEYS` .
- `IP` - Aggregate the request counts on the IP address from the web request origin. To aggregate on a combination of the IP address with other aggregate keys, use `CUSTOM_KEYS` .

ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)

An optional nested statement that narrows the scope of the web requests that are evaluated and managed by the rate-based statement. When you use a scope-down statement, the rate-based rule only tracks and rate limits requests that match the scope-down statement. You can use any nestable  Statement in the scope-down statement, and you can nest statements at any level, the same as you can for a rule statement.

ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that defines a string match search for WAF to apply to web requests. The byte match statement provides the bytes to search for, the location in requests that you want WAF to search, and other settings. The bytes to search for are typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters. In the WAF console and the developer guide, this is called a string match statement.

SearchString -> (blob)

A string value that you want WAF to search for. WAF searches only in the part of web requests that you designate for inspection in  FieldToMatch . The maximum length of the value is 200 bytes.

Valid values depend on the component that you specify for inspection in `FieldToMatch` :

- `Method` : The HTTP method that you want WAF to search for. This indicates the type of operation specified in the request.
- `UriPath` : The value that you want WAF to search for in the URI path, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .
- `JA3Fingerprint` : Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .  You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .
- `HeaderOrder` : The list of header names to match for. WAF creates a string that contains the ordered list of header names, from the headers in the web request, and then matches against that string.

If `SearchString` includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.

**If youâre using the WAF API**

Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

For example, suppose the value of `Type` is `HEADER` and the value of `Data` is `User-Agent` . If you want to search the `User-Agent` header for the value `BadBot` , you base64-encode `BadBot` using MIME base64-encoding and include the resulting value, `QmFkQm90` , in the value of `SearchString` .

**If youâre using the CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs**

The value that you want WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available cookies normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

PositionalConstraint -> (string)

The area within the portion of the web request that you want WAF to search for `SearchString` . Valid values include the following:

**CONTAINS**

The specified part of the web request must include the value of `SearchString` , but the location doesnât matter.

**CONTAINS_WORD**

The specified part of the web request must include the value of `SearchString` , and `SearchString` must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _). In addition, `SearchString` must be a word, which means that both of the following are true:

- `SearchString` is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request or is preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_). Examples include the value of a header and `;BadBot` .
- `SearchString` is at the end of the specified part of the web request or is followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, `BadBot;` and `-BadBot;` .

**EXACTLY**

The value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of `SearchString` .

**STARTS_WITH**

The value of `SearchString` must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the web request.

**ENDS_WITH**

The value of `SearchString` must appear at the end of the specified part of the web request.

SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that inspects for malicious SQL code. Attackers insert malicious SQL code into web requests to do things like modify your database or extract data from it.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).

- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers.

- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

SensitivityLevel -> (string)

The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to inspect for SQL injection attacks.

`HIGH` detects more attacks, but might generate more false positives, especially if your web requests frequently contain unusual strings. For information about identifying and mitigating false positives, see [Testing and tuning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-testing.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

`LOW` is generally a better choice for resources that already have other protections against SQL injection attacks or that have a low tolerance for false positives.

Default: `LOW`

XssMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that inspects for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. In XSS attacks, the attacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as a vehicle to inject malicious client-site scripts into other legitimate web browsers.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available cookies normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that compares a number of bytes against the size of a request component, using a comparison operator, such as greater than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can use a size constraint statement to look for query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

If you configure WAF to inspect the request body, WAF inspects only the number of bytes in the body up to the limit for the web ACL and protected resource type. If you know that the request body for your web requests should never exceed the inspection limit, you can use a size constraint statement to block requests that have a larger request body size. For more information about the inspection limits, see `Body` and `JsonBody` settings for the `FieldToMatch` data type.

If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI counts as one character. For example, the URI `/logo.jpg` is nine characters long.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).

- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

ComparisonOperator -> (string)

The operator to use to compare the request part to the size setting.

Size -> (long)

The size, in byte, to compare to the request part, after any transformations.

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys.

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that labels web requests by country and region and that matches against web requests based on country code. A geo match rule labels every request that it inspects regardless of whether it finds a match.

- To manage requests only by country, you can use this statement by itself and specify the countries that you want to match against in the `CountryCodes` array.
- Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with Count action so that it only labels requests. Then, add one or more label match rules to run after the geo match rule and configure them to match against the geographic labels and handle the requests as needed.

WAF labels requests using the alpha-2 country and region codes from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 standard. WAF determines the codes using either the IP address in the web request origin or, if you specify it, the address in the geo match `ForwardedIPConfig` .

If you use the web request origin, the label formats are `awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO region code>` and `awswaf:clientip:geo:country:<ISO country code>` .

If you use a forwarded IP address, the label formats are `awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO region code>` and `awswaf:forwardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code>` .

For additional details, see [Geographic match rule statement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-type-geo-match.html) in the [WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) .

CountryCodes -> (list)

An array of two-character country codes that you want to match against, for example, `[ "US", "CN" ]` , from the alpha-2 country ISO codes of the ISO 3166 international standard.

When you use a geo match statement just for the region and country labels that it adds to requests, you still have to supply a country code for the rule to evaluate. In this case, you configure the rule to only count matching requests, but it will still generate logging and count metrics for any matches. You can reduce the logging and metrics that the rule produces by specifying a country thatâs unlikely to be a source of traffic to your site.

(string)

ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to run the rules that are defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a rule group with your rules, then provide the ARN of the rule group in this statement.

You cannot nest a `RuleGroupReferenceStatement` , for example for use inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You cannot use a rule group reference statement inside another rule group. You can only reference a rule group as a top-level statement within a rule that you define in a web ACL.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

ExcludedRules -> (list)

Rules in the referenced rule group whose actions are set to `Count` .

### Note

Instead of this option, use `RuleActionOverrides` . It accepts any valid action setting, including `Count` .

Specifies a single rule in a rule group whose action you want to override to `Count` .

### Note

Instead of this option, use `RuleActionOverrides` . It accepts any valid action setting, including `Count` .

Name -> (string)

The name of the rule whose action you want to override to `Count` .

RuleActionOverrides -> (list)

Action settings to use in the place of the rule actions that are configured inside the rule group. You specify one override for each rule whose action you want to change.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

You can use overrides for testing, for example you can override all of rule actions to `Count` and then monitor the resulting count metrics to understand how the rule group would handle your web traffic. You can also permanently override some or all actions, to modify how the rule group manages your web traffic.

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to detect web requests coming from particular IP addresses or address ranges. To use this, create an  IPSet that specifies the addresses you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this statement. To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

Each IP set rule statement references an IP set. You create and maintain the set independent of your rules. This allows you to use the single set in multiple rules. When you update the referenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules that reference it.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  IPSet that this statement references.

IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Position -> (string)

The position in the header to search for the IP address. The header can contain IP addresses of the original client and also of proxies. For example, the header value could be `10.1.1.1, 127.0.0.0, 10.10.10.10` where the first IP address identifies the original client and the rest identify proxies that the request went through.

The options for this setting are the following:

- FIRST - Inspect the first IP address in the list of IP addresses in the header. This is usually the clientâs original IP.
- LAST - Inspect the last IP address in the list of IP addresses in the header.
- ANY - Inspect all IP addresses in the header for a match. If the header contains more than 10 IP addresses, WAF inspects the last 10.

RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to search web request components for matches with regular expressions. To use this, create a  RegexPatternSet that specifies the expressions that you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this statement. A web request matches the pattern set rule statement if the request component matches any of the patterns in the set. To create a regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

Each regex pattern set rule statement references a regex pattern set. You create and maintain the set independent of your rules. This allows you to use the single set in multiple rules. When you update the referenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules that reference it.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  RegexPatternSet that this statement references.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available cookies normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

RateBasedStatement -> (structure)

A rate-based rule counts incoming requests and rate limits requests when they are coming at too fast a rate. The rule categorizes requests according to your aggregation criteria, collects them into aggregation instances, and counts and rate limits the requests for each instance.

### Note

If you change any of these settings in a rule thatâs currently in use, the change resets the ruleâs rate limiting counts. This can pause the ruleâs rate limiting activities for up to a minute.

You can specify individual aggregation keys, like IP address or HTTP method. You can also specify aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.

Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition.

For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP address and HTTP method values:

- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

The rule would create different aggregation instances according to your aggregation criteria, for example:

- If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each individual address is an aggregation instance, and WAF counts requests separately for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3
- IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1
- If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- HTTP method POST: count 2
- HTTP method GET: count 2
- If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2
- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1

For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which WAF counts and rate-limits individually.

You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.

You cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

For additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call `GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys` . This option is not available for other aggregation configurations.

WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF.

Limit -> (long)

The limit on requests during the specified evaluation window for a single aggregation instance for the rate-based rule. If the rate-based statement includes a `ScopeDownStatement` , this limit is applied only to the requests that match the statement.

Examples:

- If you aggregate on just the IP address, this is the limit on requests from any single IP address.
- If you aggregate on the HTTP method and the query argument name âcityâ, then this is the limit on requests for any single method, city pair.

EvaluationWindowSec -> (long)

The amount of time, in seconds, that WAF should include in its request counts, looking back from the current time. For example, for a setting of 120, when WAF checks the rate, it counts the requests for the 2 minutes immediately preceding the current time. Valid settings are 60, 120, 300, and 600.

This setting doesnât determine how often WAF checks the rate, but how far back it looks each time it checks. WAF checks the rate about every 10 seconds.

Default: `300` (5 minutes)

AggregateKeyType -> (string)

Setting that indicates how to aggregate the request counts.

### Note

Web requests that are missing any of the components specified in the aggregation keys are omitted from the rate-based rule evaluation and handling.

- `CONSTANT` - Count and limit the requests that match the rate-based ruleâs scope-down statement. With this option, the counted requests arenât further aggregated. The scope-down statement is the only specification used. When the count of all requests that satisfy the scope-down statement goes over the limit, WAF applies the rule action to all requests that satisfy the scope-down statement.  With this option, you must configure the `ScopeDownStatement` property.
- `CUSTOM_KEYS` - Aggregate the request counts using one or more web request components as the aggregate keys. With this option, you must specify the aggregate keys in the `CustomKeys` property.  To aggregate on only the IP address or only the forwarded IP address, donât use custom keys. Instead, set the aggregate key type to `IP` or `FORWARDED_IP` .
- `FORWARDED_IP` - Aggregate the request counts on the first IP address in an HTTP header.  With this option, you must specify the header to use in the `ForwardedIPConfig` property.  To aggregate on a combination of the forwarded IP address with other aggregate keys, use `CUSTOM_KEYS` .
- `IP` - Aggregate the request counts on the IP address from the web request origin. To aggregate on a combination of the IP address with other aggregate keys, use `CUSTOM_KEYS` .

( â¦ recursive â¦ )ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

This is required if you specify a forwarded IP in the ruleâs aggregate key settings.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

CustomKeys -> (list)

Specifies the aggregate keys to use in a rate-base rule.

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

ForwardedIP -> (structure)

Use the first IP address in an HTTP header as an aggregate key. Each distinct forwarded IP address contributes to the aggregation instance.

When you specify an IP or forwarded IP in the custom key settings, you must also specify at least one other key to use. You can aggregate on only the forwarded IP address by specifying `FORWARDED_IP` in your rate-based statementâs `AggregateKeyType` .

With this option, you must specify the header to use in the rate-based ruleâs `ForwardedIPConfig` property.

IP -> (structure)

Use the requestâs originating IP address as an aggregate key. Each distinct IP address contributes to the aggregation instance.

When you specify an IP or forwarded IP in the custom key settings, you must also specify at least one other key to use. You can aggregate on only the IP address by specifying `IP` in your rate-based statementâs `AggregateKeyType` .

LabelNamespace -> (structure)

Use the specified label namespace as an aggregate key. Each distinct fully qualified label name that has the specified label namespace contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just one label namespace as your custom key, then each label name fully defines an aggregation instance.

This uses only labels that have been added to the request by rules that are evaluated before this rate-based rule in the web ACL.

For information about label namespaces and names, see [Label syntax and naming requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-label-requirements.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

ResponseInspection -> (structure)

The criteria for inspecting responses to login requests, used by the ATP rule group to track login failure rates.

### Note

Response inspection is available only in web ACLs that protect Amazon CloudFront distributions.

The ATP rule group evaluates the responses that your protected resources send back to client login attempts, keeping count of successful and failed attempts for each IP address and client session. Using this information, the rule group labels and mitigates requests from client sessions and IP addresses that have had too many failed login attempts in a short amount of time.

StatusCode -> (structure)

Configures inspection of the response status code for success and failure indicators.

SuccessCodes -> (list)

Status codes in the response that indicate a successful login or account creation attempt. To be counted as a success, the response status code must match one of these. Each code must be unique among the success and failure status codes.

JSON example: `"SuccessCodes": [ 200, 201 ]`

(integer)

FailureCodes -> (list)

Status codes in the response that indicate a failed login or account creation attempt. To be counted as a failure, the response status code must match one of these. Each code must be unique among the success and failure status codes.

The label match statement provides the label or namespace string to search for. The label string can represent a part or all of the fully qualified label name that had been added to the web request. Fully qualified labels have a prefix, optional namespaces, and label name. The prefix identifies the rule group or web ACL context of the rule that added the label. If you do not provide the fully qualified name in your label match string, WAF performs the search for labels that were added in the same context as the label match statement.

Scope -> (string)

Specify whether you want to match using the label name or just the namespace.

Key -> (string)

The string to match against. The setting you provide for this depends on the match statementâs `Scope` setting:

- If the `Scope` indicates `LABEL` , then this specification must include the name and can include any number of preceding namespace specifications and prefix up to providing the fully qualified label name.
- If the `Scope` indicates `NAMESPACE` , then this specification can include any number of contiguous namespace strings, and can include the entire label namespace prefix from the rule group or web ACL where the label originates.

Labels are case sensitive and components of a label must be separated by colon, for example `NS1:NS2:name` .

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available cookies normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

This is required if you specify a forwarded IP in the ruleâs aggregate key settings.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

CustomKeys -> (list)

Specifies the aggregate keys to use in a rate-base rule.

(structure)

Specifies a single custom aggregate key for a rate-base rule.

### Note

Web requests that are missing any of the components specified in the aggregation keys are omitted from the rate-based rule evaluation and handling.

Header -> (structure)

Use the value of a header in the request as an aggregate key. Each distinct value in the header contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use a single header as your custom key, then each value fully defines an aggregation instance.

Name -> (string)

The name of the header to use.

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to use.

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys.

HTTPMethod -> (structure)

Use the requestâs HTTP method as an aggregate key. Each distinct HTTP method contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just the HTTP method as your custom key, then each method fully defines an aggregation instance.

ForwardedIP -> (structure)

Use the first IP address in an HTTP header as an aggregate key. Each distinct forwarded IP address contributes to the aggregation instance.

When you specify an IP or forwarded IP in the custom key settings, you must also specify at least one other key to use. You can aggregate on only the forwarded IP address by specifying `FORWARDED_IP` in your rate-based statementâs `AggregateKeyType` .

With this option, you must specify the header to use in the rate-based ruleâs `ForwardedIPConfig` property.

IP -> (structure)

Use the requestâs originating IP address as an aggregate key. Each distinct IP address contributes to the aggregation instance.

When you specify an IP or forwarded IP in the custom key settings, you must also specify at least one other key to use. You can aggregate on only the IP address by specifying `IP` in your rate-based statementâs `AggregateKeyType` .

LabelNamespace -> (structure)

Use the specified label namespace as an aggregate key. Each distinct fully qualified label name that has the specified label namespace contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just one label namespace as your custom key, then each label name fully defines an aggregation instance.

This uses only labels that have been added to the request by rules that are evaluated before this rate-based rule in the web ACL.

For information about label namespaces and names, see [Label syntax and naming requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-label-requirements.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Namespace -> (string)

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Use the requestâs JA3 fingerprint as an aggregate key. If you use a single JA3 fingerprint as your custom key, then each value fully defines an aggregation instance.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if there is insufficient TSL Client Hello information to compute the JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Use the requestâs JA4 fingerprint as an aggregate key. If you use a single JA4 fingerprint as your custom key, then each value fully defines an aggregation instance.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

AndStatement -> (structure)

A logical rule statement used to combine other rule statements with AND logic. You provide more than one  Statement within the `AndStatement` .

Statements -> (list)

The statements to combine with AND logic. You can use any statements that can be nested.

(structure)

The processing guidance for a  Rule , used by WAF to determine whether a web request matches the rule.

For example specifications, see the examples section of  CreateWebACL .

ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that defines a string match search for WAF to apply to web requests. The byte match statement provides the bytes to search for, the location in requests that you want WAF to search, and other settings. The bytes to search for are typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters. In the WAF console and the developer guide, this is called a string match statement.

SearchString -> (blob)

A string value that you want WAF to search for. WAF searches only in the part of web requests that you designate for inspection in  FieldToMatch . The maximum length of the value is 200 bytes.

Valid values depend on the component that you specify for inspection in `FieldToMatch` :

- `Method` : The HTTP method that you want WAF to search for. This indicates the type of operation specified in the request.
- `UriPath` : The value that you want WAF to search for in the URI path, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .
- `JA3Fingerprint` : Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .  You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .
- `HeaderOrder` : The list of header names to match for. WAF creates a string that contains the ordered list of header names, from the headers in the web request, and then matches against that string.

If `SearchString` includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.

**If youâre using the WAF API**

Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

For example, suppose the value of `Type` is `HEADER` and the value of `Data` is `User-Agent` . If you want to search the `User-Agent` header for the value `BadBot` , you base64-encode `BadBot` using MIME base64-encoding and include the resulting value, `QmFkQm90` , in the value of `SearchString` .

**If youâre using the CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs**

The value that you want WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

PositionalConstraint -> (string)

The area within the portion of the web request that you want WAF to search for `SearchString` . Valid values include the following:

**CONTAINS**

The specified part of the web request must include the value of `SearchString` , but the location doesnât matter.

**CONTAINS_WORD**

The specified part of the web request must include the value of `SearchString` , and `SearchString` must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _). In addition, `SearchString` must be a word, which means that both of the following are true:

- `SearchString` is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request or is preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_). Examples include the value of a header and `;BadBot` .
- `SearchString` is at the end of the specified part of the web request or is followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, `BadBot;` and `-BadBot;` .

**EXACTLY**

The value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of `SearchString` .

**STARTS_WITH**

The value of `SearchString` must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the web request.

**ENDS_WITH**

The value of `SearchString` must appear at the end of the specified part of the web request.

SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that inspects for malicious SQL code. Attackers insert malicious SQL code into web requests to do things like modify your database or extract data from it.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

SensitivityLevel -> (string)

The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to inspect for SQL injection attacks.

`HIGH` detects more attacks, but might generate more false positives, especially if your web requests frequently contain unusual strings. For information about identifying and mitigating false positives, see [Testing and tuning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-testing.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

`LOW` is generally a better choice for resources that already have other protections against SQL injection attacks or that have a low tolerance for false positives.

Default: `LOW`

XssMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that inspects for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. In XSS attacks, the attacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as a vehicle to inject malicious client-site scripts into other legitimate web browsers.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers.

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers.

- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that compares a number of bytes against the size of a request component, using a comparison operator, such as greater than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can use a size constraint statement to look for query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

If you configure WAF to inspect the request body, WAF inspects only the number of bytes in the body up to the limit for the web ACL and protected resource type. If you know that the request body for your web requests should never exceed the inspection limit, you can use a size constraint statement to block requests that have a larger request body size. For more information about the inspection limits, see `Body` and `JsonBody` settings for the `FieldToMatch` data type.

If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI counts as one character. For example, the URI `/logo.jpg` is nine characters long.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available cookies normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

ComparisonOperator -> (string)

The operator to use to compare the request part to the size setting.

Size -> (long)

The size, in byte, to compare to the request part, after any transformations.

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that labels web requests by country and region and that matches against web requests based on country code. A geo match rule labels every request that it inspects regardless of whether it finds a match.

- To manage requests only by country, you can use this statement by itself and specify the countries that you want to match against in the `CountryCodes` array.
- Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with Count action so that it only labels requests. Then, add one or more label match rules to run after the geo match rule and configure them to match against the geographic labels and handle the requests as needed.

WAF labels requests using the alpha-2 country and region codes from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 standard. WAF determines the codes using either the IP address in the web request origin or, if you specify it, the address in the geo match `ForwardedIPConfig` .

If you use the web request origin, the label formats are `awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO region code>` and `awswaf:clientip:geo:country:<ISO country code>` .

If you use a forwarded IP address, the label formats are `awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO region code>` and `awswaf:forwardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code>` .

For additional details, see [Geographic match rule statement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-type-geo-match.html) in the [WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) .

CountryCodes -> (list)

An array of two-character country codes that you want to match against, for example, `[ "US", "CN" ]` , from the alpha-2 country ISO codes of the ISO 3166 international standard.

When you use a geo match statement just for the region and country labels that it adds to requests, you still have to supply a country code for the rule to evaluate. In this case, you configure the rule to only count matching requests, but it will still generate logging and count metrics for any matches. You can reduce the logging and metrics that the rule produces by specifying a country thatâs unlikely to be a source of traffic to your site.

(string)

ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to run the rules that are defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a rule group with your rules, then provide the ARN of the rule group in this statement.

You cannot nest a `RuleGroupReferenceStatement` , for example for use inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You cannot use a rule group reference statement inside another rule group. You can only reference a rule group as a top-level statement within a rule that you define in a web ACL.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

ExcludedRules -> (list)

Rules in the referenced rule group whose actions are set to `Count` .

### Note

Instead of this option, use `RuleActionOverrides` . It accepts any valid action setting, including `Count` .

(structure)

Specifies a single rule in a rule group whose action you want to override to `Count` .

### Note

Instead of this option, use `RuleActionOverrides` . It accepts any valid action setting, including `Count` .

Name -> (string)

The name of the rule whose action you want to override to `Count` .

RuleActionOverrides -> (list)

Action settings to use in the place of the rule actions that are configured inside the rule group. You specify one override for each rule whose action you want to change.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

You can use overrides for testing, for example you can override all of rule actions to `Count` and then monitor the resulting count metrics to understand how the rule group would handle your web traffic. You can also permanently override some or all actions, to modify how the rule group manages your web traffic.

(structure)

Action setting to use in the place of a rule action that is configured inside the rule group. You specify one override for each rule whose action you want to change.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

You can use overrides for testing, for example you can override all of rule actions to `Count` and then monitor the resulting count metrics to understand how the rule group would handle your web traffic. You can also permanently override some or all actions, to modify how the rule group manages your web traffic.

Name -> (string)

The name of the rule to override.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

ActionToUse -> (structure)

The override action to use, in place of the configured action of the rule in the rule group.

Block -> (structure)

Instructs WAF to block the web request.

ResponseCode -> (integer)

The HTTP status code to return to the client.

For a list of status codes that you can use in your custom responses, see [Supported status codes for custom response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/customizing-the-response-status-codes.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)

References the response body that you want WAF to return to the web request client. You can define a custom response for a rule action or a default web ACL action that is set to block. To do this, you first define the response body key and value in the `CustomResponseBodies` setting for the  WebACL or  RuleGroup where you want to use it. Then, in the rule action or web ACL default action `BlockAction` setting, you reference the response body using this key.

ResponseHeaders -> (list)

The HTTP headers to use in the response. You can specify any header name except for `content-type` . Duplicate header names are not allowed.

For information about the limits on count and size for custom request and response settings, see [WAF quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/limits.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

(structure)

A custom header for custom request and response handling. This is used in  CustomResponse and  CustomRequestHandling .

Name -> (string)

The name of the custom header.

For custom request header insertion, when WAF inserts the header into the request, it prefixes this name `x-amzn-waf-` , to avoid confusion with the headers that are already in the request. For example, for the header name `sample` , WAF inserts the header `x-amzn-waf-sample` .

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

Allow -> (structure)

Instructs WAF to allow the web request.

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to detect web requests coming from particular IP addresses or address ranges. To use this, create an  IPSet that specifies the addresses you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this statement. To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

Each IP set rule statement references an IP set. You create and maintain the set independent of your rules. This allows you to use the single set in multiple rules. When you update the referenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules that reference it.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  IPSet that this statement references.

IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Position -> (string)

The position in the header to search for the IP address. The header can contain IP addresses of the original client and also of proxies. For example, the header value could be `10.1.1.1, 127.0.0.0, 10.10.10.10` where the first IP address identifies the original client and the rest identify proxies that the request went through.

The options for this setting are the following:

- FIRST - Inspect the first IP address in the list of IP addresses in the header. This is usually the clientâs original IP.
- LAST - Inspect the last IP address in the list of IP addresses in the header.
- ANY - Inspect all IP addresses in the header for a match. If the header contains more than 10 IP addresses, WAF inspects the last 10.

RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to search web request components for matches with regular expressions. To use this, create a  RegexPatternSet that specifies the expressions that you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this statement. A web request matches the pattern set rule statement if the request component matches any of the patterns in the set. To create a regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

Each regex pattern set rule statement references a regex pattern set. You create and maintain the set independent of your rules. This allows you to use the single set in multiple rules. When you update the referenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules that reference it.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  RegexPatternSet that this statement references.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available cookies normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

RateBasedStatement -> (structure)

A rate-based rule counts incoming requests and rate limits requests when they are coming at too fast a rate. The rule categorizes requests according to your aggregation criteria, collects them into aggregation instances, and counts and rate limits the requests for each instance.

### Note

If you change any of these settings in a rule thatâs currently in use, the change resets the ruleâs rate limiting counts. This can pause the ruleâs rate limiting activities for up to a minute.

You can specify individual aggregation keys, like IP address or HTTP method. You can also specify aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.

Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition.

For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP address and HTTP method values:

- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

The rule would create different aggregation instances according to your aggregation criteria, for example:

- If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each individual address is an aggregation instance, and WAF counts requests separately for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3
- IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1
- If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- HTTP method POST: count 2
- HTTP method GET: count 2
- If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2
- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1

For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which WAF counts and rate-limits individually.

You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.

You cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

For additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call `GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys` . This option is not available for other aggregation configurations.

WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF.

Limit -> (long)

The limit on requests during the specified evaluation window for a single aggregation instance for the rate-based rule. If the rate-based statement includes a `ScopeDownStatement` , this limit is applied only to the requests that match the statement.

Examples:

- If you aggregate on just the IP address, this is the limit on requests from any single IP address.
- If you aggregate on the HTTP method and the query argument name âcityâ, then this is the limit on requests for any single method, city pair.

EvaluationWindowSec -> (long)

The amount of time, in seconds, that WAF should include in its request counts, looking back from the current time. For example, for a setting of 120, when WAF checks the rate, it counts the requests for the 2 minutes immediately preceding the current time. Valid settings are 60, 120, 300, and 600.

This setting doesnât determine how often WAF checks the rate, but how far back it looks each time it checks. WAF checks the rate about every 10 seconds.

Default: `300` (5 minutes)

AggregateKeyType -> (string)

Setting that indicates how to aggregate the request counts.

### Note

Web requests that are missing any of the components specified in the aggregation keys are omitted from the rate-based rule evaluation and handling.

- `CONSTANT` - Count and limit the requests that match the rate-based ruleâs scope-down statement. With this option, the counted requests arenât further aggregated. The scope-down statement is the only specification used. When the count of all requests that satisfy the scope-down statement goes over the limit, WAF applies the rule action to all requests that satisfy the scope-down statement.  With this option, you must configure the `ScopeDownStatement` property.
- `CUSTOM_KEYS` - Aggregate the request counts using one or more web request components as the aggregate keys. With this option, you must specify the aggregate keys in the `CustomKeys` property.  To aggregate on only the IP address or only the forwarded IP address, donât use custom keys. Instead, set the aggregate key type to `IP` or `FORWARDED_IP` .
- `FORWARDED_IP` - Aggregate the request counts on the first IP address in an HTTP header.  With this option, you must specify the header to use in the `ForwardedIPConfig` property.  To aggregate on a combination of the forwarded IP address with other aggregate keys, use `CUSTOM_KEYS` .
- `IP` - Aggregate the request counts on the IP address from the web request origin. To aggregate on a combination of the IP address with other aggregate keys, use `CUSTOM_KEYS` .

( â¦ recursive â¦ )ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

This is required if you specify a forwarded IP in the ruleâs aggregate key settings.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

CustomKeys -> (list)

Specifies the aggregate keys to use in a rate-base rule.

(structure)

Specifies a single custom aggregate key for a rate-base rule.

### Note

Web requests that are missing any of the components specified in the aggregation keys are omitted from the rate-based rule evaluation and handling.

Header -> (structure)

Use the value of a header in the request as an aggregate key. Each distinct value in the header contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use a single header as your custom key, then each value fully defines an aggregation instance.

Name -> (string)

The name of the header to use.

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

Cookie -> (structure)

Use the value of a cookie in the request as an aggregate key. Each distinct value in the cookie contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use a single cookie as your custom key, then each value fully defines an aggregation instance.

Name -> (string)

The name of the cookie to use.

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys.

Use the requestâs HTTP method as an aggregate key. Each distinct HTTP method contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just the HTTP method as your custom key, then each method fully defines an aggregation instance.

ForwardedIP -> (structure)

Use the first IP address in an HTTP header as an aggregate key. Each distinct forwarded IP address contributes to the aggregation instance.

When you specify an IP or forwarded IP in the custom key settings, you must also specify at least one other key to use. You can aggregate on only the forwarded IP address by specifying `FORWARDED_IP` in your rate-based statementâs `AggregateKeyType` .

With this option, you must specify the header to use in the rate-based ruleâs `ForwardedIPConfig` property.

IP -> (structure)

Use the requestâs originating IP address as an aggregate key. Each distinct IP address contributes to the aggregation instance.

When you specify an IP or forwarded IP in the custom key settings, you must also specify at least one other key to use. You can aggregate on only the IP address by specifying `IP` in your rate-based statementâs `AggregateKeyType` .

LabelNamespace -> (structure)

Use the specified label namespace as an aggregate key. Each distinct fully qualified label name that has the specified label namespace contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just one label namespace as your custom key, then each label name fully defines an aggregation instance.

This uses only labels that have been added to the request by rules that are evaluated before this rate-based rule in the web ACL.

For information about label namespaces and names, see [Label syntax and naming requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-label-requirements.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Namespace -> (string)

The namespace to use for aggregation.

UriPath -> (structure)

Use the requestâs URI path as an aggregate key. Each distinct URI path contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just the URI path as your custom key, then each URI path fully defines an aggregation instance.

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if there is insufficient TSL Client Hello information to compute the JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Use the requestâs JA4 fingerprint as an aggregate key. If you use a single JA4 fingerprint as your custom key, then each value fully defines an aggregation instance.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if there is insufficient TSL Client Hello information to compute the JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

For example, for the JSON payload `{ "form": { "primaryaddressline1": "THE_ADDRESS1", "primaryaddressline2": "THE_ADDRESS2", "primaryaddressline3": "THE_ADDRESS3" } }` , the address field idenfiers are `/form/primaryaddressline1` , `/form/primaryaddressline2` , and `/form/primaryaddressline3` .
- For form encoded payload types, use the HTML form names. For example, for an HTML form with input elements named `primaryaddressline1` , `primaryaddressline2` , and `primaryaddressline3` , the address fields identifiers are `primaryaddressline1` , `primaryaddressline2` , and `primaryaddressline3` .

ResponseInspection -> (structure)

The criteria for inspecting responses to account creation requests, used by the ACFP rule group to track account creation success rates.

### Note

Response inspection is available only in web ACLs that protect Amazon CloudFront distributions.

The ACFP rule group evaluates the responses that your protected resources send back to client account creation attempts, keeping count of successful and failed attempts from each IP address and client session. Using this information, the rule group labels and mitigates requests from client sessions and IP addresses that have had too many successful account creation attempts in a short amount of time.

SuccessCodes -> (list)

Status codes in the response that indicate a successful login or account creation attempt. To be counted as a success, the response status code must match one of these. Each code must be unique among the success and failure status codes.

JSON example: `"SuccessCodes": [ 200, 201 ]`

(integer)

FailureCodes -> (list)

Status codes in the response that indicate a failed login or account creation attempt. To be counted as a failure, the response status code must match one of these. Each code must be unique among the success and failure status codes.

JSON examples: `"Identifier": [ "/login/success" ]` and `"Identifier": [ "/sign-up/success" ]`

SuccessValues -> (list)

Values for the specified identifier in the response JSON that indicate a successful login or account creation attempt. To be counted as a success, the value must be an exact match, including case. Each value must be unique among the success and failure values.

JSON example: `"SuccessValues": [ "True", "Succeeded" ]`

(string)

FailureValues -> (list)

Values for the specified identifier in the response JSON that indicate a failed login or account creation attempt. To be counted as a failure, the value must be an exact match, including case. Each value must be unique among the success and failure values.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

You can use overrides for testing, for example you can override all of rule actions to `Count` and then monitor the resulting count metrics to understand how the rule group would handle your web traffic. You can also permanently override some or all actions, to modify how the rule group manages your web traffic.

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement to match against labels that have been added to the web request by rules that have already run in the web ACL.

The label match statement provides the label or namespace string to search for. The label string can represent a part or all of the fully qualified label name that had been added to the web request. Fully qualified labels have a prefix, optional namespaces, and label name. The prefix identifies the rule group or web ACL context of the rule that added the label. If you do not provide the fully qualified name in your label match string, WAF performs the search for labels that were added in the same context as the label match statement.

Scope -> (string)

Specify whether you want to match using the label name or just the namespace.

Key -> (string)

The string to match against. The setting you provide for this depends on the match statementâs `Scope` setting:

- If the `Scope` indicates `LABEL` , then this specification must include the name and can include any number of preceding namespace specifications and prefix up to providing the fully qualified label name.
- If the `Scope` indicates `NAMESPACE` , then this specification can include any number of contiguous namespace strings, and can include the entire label namespace prefix from the rule group or web ACL where the label originates.

Labels are case sensitive and components of a label must be separated by colon, for example `NS1:NS2:name` .

RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to search web request components for a match against a single regular expression.

RegexString -> (string)

The string representing the regular expression.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies.

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OrStatement -> (structure)

A logical rule statement used to combine other rule statements with OR logic. You provide more than one  Statement within the `OrStatement` .

Statements -> (list)

The statements to combine with OR logic. You can use any statements that can be nested.

(structure)

The processing guidance for a  Rule , used by WAF to determine whether a web request matches the rule.

For example specifications, see the examples section of  CreateWebACL .

ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that defines a string match search for WAF to apply to web requests. The byte match statement provides the bytes to search for, the location in requests that you want WAF to search, and other settings. The bytes to search for are typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters. In the WAF console and the developer guide, this is called a string match statement.

SearchString -> (blob)

A string value that you want WAF to search for. WAF searches only in the part of web requests that you designate for inspection in  FieldToMatch . The maximum length of the value is 200 bytes.

Valid values depend on the component that you specify for inspection in `FieldToMatch` :

- `Method` : The HTTP method that you want WAF to search for. This indicates the type of operation specified in the request.
- `UriPath` : The value that you want WAF to search for in the URI path, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .
- `JA3Fingerprint` : Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .  You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .
- `HeaderOrder` : The list of header names to match for. WAF creates a string that contains the ordered list of header names, from the headers in the web request, and then matches against that string.

If `SearchString` includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.

**If youâre using the WAF API**

Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

For example, suppose the value of `Type` is `HEADER` and the value of `Data` is `User-Agent` . If you want to search the `User-Agent` header for the value `BadBot` , you base64-encode `BadBot` using MIME base64-encoding and include the resulting value, `QmFkQm90` , in the value of `SearchString` .

**If youâre using the CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs**

The value that you want WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs.

The area within the portion of the web request that you want WAF to search for `SearchString` . Valid values include the following:

**CONTAINS**

The specified part of the web request must include the value of `SearchString` , but the location doesnât matter.

**CONTAINS_WORD**

The specified part of the web request must include the value of `SearchString` , and `SearchString` must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _). In addition, `SearchString` must be a word, which means that both of the following are true:

- `SearchString` is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request or is preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_). Examples include the value of a header and `;BadBot` .
- `SearchString` is at the end of the specified part of the web request or is followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, `BadBot;` and `-BadBot;` .

**EXACTLY**

The value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of `SearchString` .

**STARTS_WITH**

The value of `SearchString` must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the web request.

**ENDS_WITH**

The value of `SearchString` must appear at the end of the specified part of the web request.

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available cookies normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

SensitivityLevel -> (string)

The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to inspect for SQL injection attacks.

`HIGH` detects more attacks, but might generate more false positives, especially if your web requests frequently contain unusual strings. For information about identifying and mitigating false positives, see [Testing and tuning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-testing.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

`LOW` is generally a better choice for resources that already have other protections against SQL injection attacks or that have a low tolerance for false positives.

Default: `LOW`

XssMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that inspects for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. In XSS attacks, the attacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as a vehicle to inject malicious client-site scripts into other legitimate web browsers.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that compares a number of bytes against the size of a request component, using a comparison operator, such as greater than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can use a size constraint statement to look for query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

If you configure WAF to inspect the request body, WAF inspects only the number of bytes in the body up to the limit for the web ACL and protected resource type. If you know that the request body for your web requests should never exceed the inspection limit, you can use a size constraint statement to block requests that have a larger request body size. For more information about the inspection limits, see `Body` and `JsonBody` settings for the `FieldToMatch` data type.

If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI counts as one character. For example, the URI `/logo.jpg` is nine characters long.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior.

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available cookies normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

ComparisonOperator -> (string)

The operator to use to compare the request part to the size setting.

Size -> (long)

The size, in byte, to compare to the request part, after any transformations.

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that labels web requests by country and region and that matches against web requests based on country code. A geo match rule labels every request that it inspects regardless of whether it finds a match.

- To manage requests only by country, you can use this statement by itself and specify the countries that you want to match against in the `CountryCodes` array.
- Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with Count action so that it only labels requests. Then, add one or more label match rules to run after the geo match rule and configure them to match against the geographic labels and handle the requests as needed.

WAF labels requests using the alpha-2 country and region codes from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 standard. WAF determines the codes using either the IP address in the web request origin or, if you specify it, the address in the geo match `ForwardedIPConfig` .

If you use the web request origin, the label formats are `awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO region code>` and `awswaf:clientip:geo:country:<ISO country code>` .

If you use a forwarded IP address, the label formats are `awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO region code>` and `awswaf:forwardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code>` .

For additional details, see [Geographic match rule statement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-type-geo-match.html) in the [WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) .

CountryCodes -> (list)

An array of two-character country codes that you want to match against, for example, `[ "US", "CN" ]` , from the alpha-2 country ISO codes of the ISO 3166 international standard.

When you use a geo match statement just for the region and country labels that it adds to requests, you still have to supply a country code for the rule to evaluate. In this case, you configure the rule to only count matching requests, but it will still generate logging and count metrics for any matches. You can reduce the logging and metrics that the rule produces by specifying a country thatâs unlikely to be a source of traffic to your site.

(string)

ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to run the rules that are defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a rule group with your rules, then provide the ARN of the rule group in this statement.

You cannot nest a `RuleGroupReferenceStatement` , for example for use inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You cannot use a rule group reference statement inside another rule group. You can only reference a rule group as a top-level statement within a rule that you define in a web ACL.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

ExcludedRules -> (list)

Rules in the referenced rule group whose actions are set to `Count` .

### Note

Instead of this option, use `RuleActionOverrides` . It accepts any valid action setting, including `Count` .

(structure)

Specifies a single rule in a rule group whose action you want to override to `Count` .

### Note

Instead of this option, use `RuleActionOverrides` . It accepts any valid action setting, including `Count` .

Name -> (string)

The name of the rule whose action you want to override to `Count` .

RuleActionOverrides -> (list)

Action settings to use in the place of the rule actions that are configured inside the rule group. You specify one override for each rule whose action you want to change.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

You can use overrides for testing, for example you can override all of rule actions to `Count` and then monitor the resulting count metrics to understand how the rule group would handle your web traffic. You can also permanently override some or all actions, to modify how the rule group manages your web traffic.

(structure)

Action setting to use in the place of a rule action that is configured inside the rule group. You specify one override for each rule whose action you want to change.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

You can use overrides for testing, for example you can override all of rule actions to `Count` and then monitor the resulting count metrics to understand how the rule group would handle your web traffic. You can also permanently override some or all actions, to modify how the rule group manages your web traffic.

Name -> (string)

The name of the rule to override.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

ActionToUse -> (structure)

The override action to use, in place of the configured action of the rule in the rule group.

Block -> (structure)

Instructs WAF to block the web request.

CustomResponse -> (structure)

Defines a custom response for the web request.

ResponseCode -> (integer)

The HTTP status code to return to the client.

For a list of status codes that you can use in your custom responses, see [Supported status codes for custom response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/customizing-the-response-status-codes.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)

References the response body that you want WAF to return to the web request client. You can define a custom response for a rule action or a default web ACL action that is set to block. To do this, you first define the response body key and value in the `CustomResponseBodies` setting for the  WebACL or  RuleGroup where you want to use it. Then, in the rule action or web ACL default action `BlockAction` setting, you reference the response body using this key.

ResponseHeaders -> (list)

The HTTP headers to use in the response. You can specify any header name except for `content-type` . Duplicate header names are not allowed.

For information about the limits on count and size for custom request and response settings, see [WAF quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/limits.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

(structure)

A custom header for custom request and response handling. This is used in  CustomResponse and  CustomRequestHandling .

Name -> (string)

The name of the custom header.

For custom request header insertion, when WAF inserts the header into the request, it prefixes this name `x-amzn-waf-` , to avoid confusion with the headers that are already in the request. For example, for the header name `sample` , WAF inserts the header `x-amzn-waf-sample` .

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

Allow -> (structure)

Instructs WAF to allow the web request.

CustomRequestHandling -> (structure)

Defines custom handling for the web request.

(structure)

A custom header for custom request and response handling. This is used in  CustomResponse and  CustomRequestHandling .

Name -> (string)

The name of the custom header.

For custom request header insertion, when WAF inserts the header into the request, it prefixes this name `x-amzn-waf-` , to avoid confusion with the headers that are already in the request. For example, for the header name `sample` , WAF inserts the header `x-amzn-waf-sample` .

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

Count -> (structure)

Instructs WAF to count the web request and then continue evaluating the request using the remaining rules in the web ACL.

CustomRequestHandling -> (structure)

Defines custom handling for the web request.

For information about customizing web requests and responses, see [Customizing web requests and responses in WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-custom-request-response.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

InsertHeaders -> (list)

The HTTP headers to insert into the request. Duplicate header names are not allowed.

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to detect web requests coming from particular IP addresses or address ranges. To use this, create an  IPSet that specifies the addresses you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this statement. To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

Each IP set rule statement references an IP set. You create and maintain the set independent of your rules. This allows you to use the single set in multiple rules. When you update the referenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules that reference it.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  IPSet that this statement references.

IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Position -> (string)

The position in the header to search for the IP address. The header can contain IP addresses of the original client and also of proxies. For example, the header value could be `10.1.1.1, 127.0.0.0, 10.10.10.10` where the first IP address identifies the original client and the rest identify proxies that the request went through.

The options for this setting are the following:

- FIRST - Inspect the first IP address in the list of IP addresses in the header. This is usually the clientâs original IP.
- LAST - Inspect the last IP address in the list of IP addresses in the header.
- ANY - Inspect all IP addresses in the header for a match. If the header contains more than 10 IP addresses, WAF inspects the last 10.

RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to search web request components for matches with regular expressions. To use this, create a  RegexPatternSet that specifies the expressions that you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this statement. A web request matches the pattern set rule statement if the request component matches any of the patterns in the set. To create a regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

Each regex pattern set rule statement references a regex pattern set. You create and maintain the set independent of your rules. This allows you to use the single set in multiple rules. When you update the referenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules that reference it.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  RegexPatternSet that this statement references.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available cookies normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

RateBasedStatement -> (structure)

A rate-based rule counts incoming requests and rate limits requests when they are coming at too fast a rate. The rule categorizes requests according to your aggregation criteria, collects them into aggregation instances, and counts and rate limits the requests for each instance.

### Note

If you change any of these settings in a rule thatâs currently in use, the change resets the ruleâs rate limiting counts. This can pause the ruleâs rate limiting activities for up to a minute.

You can specify individual aggregation keys, like IP address or HTTP method. You can also specify aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.

Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition.

For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP address and HTTP method values:

- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

The rule would create different aggregation instances according to your aggregation criteria, for example:

- If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each individual address is an aggregation instance, and WAF counts requests separately for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3
- IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1
- If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- HTTP method POST: count 2
- HTTP method GET: count 2
- If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2
- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1

For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which WAF counts and rate-limits individually.

You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.

You cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

For additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call `GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys` . This option is not available for other aggregation configurations.

WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF.

Limit -> (long)

The limit on requests during the specified evaluation window for a single aggregation instance for the rate-based rule. If the rate-based statement includes a `ScopeDownStatement` , this limit is applied only to the requests that match the statement.

Examples:

- If you aggregate on just the IP address, this is the limit on requests from any single IP address.
- If you aggregate on the HTTP method and the query argument name âcityâ, then this is the limit on requests for any single method, city pair.

EvaluationWindowSec -> (long)

The amount of time, in seconds, that WAF should include in its request counts, looking back from the current time. For example, for a setting of 120, when WAF checks the rate, it counts the requests for the 2 minutes immediately preceding the current time. Valid settings are 60, 120, 300, and 600.

This setting doesnât determine how often WAF checks the rate, but how far back it looks each time it checks. WAF checks the rate about every 10 seconds.

Default: `300` (5 minutes)

AggregateKeyType -> (string)

Setting that indicates how to aggregate the request counts.

### Note

Web requests that are missing any of the components specified in the aggregation keys are omitted from the rate-based rule evaluation and handling.

- `CONSTANT` - Count and limit the requests that match the rate-based ruleâs scope-down statement. With this option, the counted requests arenât further aggregated. The scope-down statement is the only specification used. When the count of all requests that satisfy the scope-down statement goes over the limit, WAF applies the rule action to all requests that satisfy the scope-down statement.  With this option, you must configure the `ScopeDownStatement` property.
- `CUSTOM_KEYS` - Aggregate the request counts using one or more web request components as the aggregate keys. With this option, you must specify the aggregate keys in the `CustomKeys` property.  To aggregate on only the IP address or only the forwarded IP address, donât use custom keys. Instead, set the aggregate key type to `IP` or `FORWARDED_IP` .
- `FORWARDED_IP` - Aggregate the request counts on the first IP address in an HTTP header.  With this option, you must specify the header to use in the `ForwardedIPConfig` property.  To aggregate on a combination of the forwarded IP address with other aggregate keys, use `CUSTOM_KEYS` .
- `IP` - Aggregate the request counts on the IP address from the web request origin. To aggregate on a combination of the IP address with other aggregate keys, use `CUSTOM_KEYS` .

( â¦ recursive â¦ )ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

This is required if you specify a forwarded IP in the ruleâs aggregate key settings.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement to match against labels that have been added to the web request by rules that have already run in the web ACL.

The label match statement provides the label or namespace string to search for. The label string can represent a part or all of the fully qualified label name that had been added to the web request. Fully qualified labels have a prefix, optional namespaces, and label name. The prefix identifies the rule group or web ACL context of the rule that added the label. If you do not provide the fully qualified name in your label match string, WAF performs the search for labels that were added in the same context as the label match statement.

Scope -> (string)

Specify whether you want to match using the label name or just the namespace.

Key -> (string)

The string to match against. The setting you provide for this depends on the match statementâs `Scope` setting:

- If the `Scope` indicates `LABEL` , then this specification must include the name and can include any number of preceding namespace specifications and prefix up to providing the fully qualified label name.
- If the `Scope` indicates `NAMESPACE` , then this specification can include any number of contiguous namespace strings, and can include the entire label namespace prefix from the rule group or web ACL where the label originates.

Labels are case sensitive and components of a label must be separated by colon, for example `NS1:NS2:name` .

RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to search web request components for a match against a single regular expression.

RegexString -> (string)

The string representing the regular expression.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

NotStatement -> (structure)

A logical rule statement used to negate the results of another rule statement. You provide one  Statement within the `NotStatement` .

Statement -> (structure)

The statement to negate. You can use any statement that can be nested.

ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that defines a string match search for WAF to apply to web requests. The byte match statement provides the bytes to search for, the location in requests that you want WAF to search, and other settings. The bytes to search for are typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters. In the WAF console and the developer guide, this is called a string match statement.

SearchString -> (blob)

A string value that you want WAF to search for. WAF searches only in the part of web requests that you designate for inspection in  FieldToMatch . The maximum length of the value is 200 bytes.

Valid values depend on the component that you specify for inspection in `FieldToMatch` :

- `Method` : The HTTP method that you want WAF to search for. This indicates the type of operation specified in the request.
- `UriPath` : The value that you want WAF to search for in the URI path, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .
- `JA3Fingerprint` : Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .  You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .
- `HeaderOrder` : The list of header names to match for. WAF creates a string that contains the ordered list of header names, from the headers in the web request, and then matches against that string.

If `SearchString` includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.

**If youâre using the WAF API**

Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

For example, suppose the value of `Type` is `HEADER` and the value of `Data` is `User-Agent` . If you want to search the `User-Agent` header for the value `BadBot` , you base64-encode `BadBot` using MIME base64-encoding and include the resulting value, `QmFkQm90` , in the value of `SearchString` .

**If youâre using the CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs**

The value that you want WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

PositionalConstraint -> (string)

The area within the portion of the web request that you want WAF to search for `SearchString` . Valid values include the following:

**CONTAINS**

The specified part of the web request must include the value of `SearchString` , but the location doesnât matter.

**CONTAINS_WORD**

The specified part of the web request must include the value of `SearchString` , and `SearchString` must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _). In addition, `SearchString` must be a word, which means that both of the following are true:

- `SearchString` is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request or is preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_). Examples include the value of a header and `;BadBot` .
- `SearchString` is at the end of the specified part of the web request or is followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, `BadBot;` and `-BadBot;` .

**EXACTLY**

The value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of `SearchString` .

**STARTS_WITH**

The value of `SearchString` must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the web request.

**ENDS_WITH**

The value of `SearchString` must appear at the end of the specified part of the web request.

SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that inspects for malicious SQL code. Attackers insert malicious SQL code into web requests to do things like modify your database or extract data from it.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).

- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies.

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior.

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

SensitivityLevel -> (string)

The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to inspect for SQL injection attacks.

`HIGH` detects more attacks, but might generate more false positives, especially if your web requests frequently contain unusual strings. For information about identifying and mitigating false positives, see [Testing and tuning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-testing.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

`LOW` is generally a better choice for resources that already have other protections against SQL injection attacks or that have a low tolerance for false positives.

Default: `LOW`

XssMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that inspects for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. In XSS attacks, the attacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as a vehicle to inject malicious client-site scripts into other legitimate web browsers.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available cookies normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that compares a number of bytes against the size of a request component, using a comparison operator, such as greater than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can use a size constraint statement to look for query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

If you configure WAF to inspect the request body, WAF inspects only the number of bytes in the body up to the limit for the web ACL and protected resource type. If you know that the request body for your web requests should never exceed the inspection limit, you can use a size constraint statement to block requests that have a larger request body size. For more information about the inspection limits, see `Body` and `JsonBody` settings for the `FieldToMatch` data type.

If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI counts as one character. For example, the URI `/logo.jpg` is nine characters long.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior.

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that labels web requests by country and region and that matches against web requests based on country code. A geo match rule labels every request that it inspects regardless of whether it finds a match.

- To manage requests only by country, you can use this statement by itself and specify the countries that you want to match against in the `CountryCodes` array.
- Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with Count action so that it only labels requests. Then, add one or more label match rules to run after the geo match rule and configure them to match against the geographic labels and handle the requests as needed.

WAF labels requests using the alpha-2 country and region codes from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 standard. WAF determines the codes using either the IP address in the web request origin or, if you specify it, the address in the geo match `ForwardedIPConfig` .

If you use the web request origin, the label formats are `awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO region code>` and `awswaf:clientip:geo:country:<ISO country code>` .

If you use a forwarded IP address, the label formats are `awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO region code>` and `awswaf:forwardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code>` .

For additional details, see [Geographic match rule statement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-type-geo-match.html) in the [WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) .

CountryCodes -> (list)

An array of two-character country codes that you want to match against, for example, `[ "US", "CN" ]` , from the alpha-2 country ISO codes of the ISO 3166 international standard.

When you use a geo match statement just for the region and country labels that it adds to requests, you still have to supply a country code for the rule to evaluate. In this case, you configure the rule to only count matching requests, but it will still generate logging and count metrics for any matches. You can reduce the logging and metrics that the rule produces by specifying a country thatâs unlikely to be a source of traffic to your site.

(string)

ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to run the rules that are defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a rule group with your rules, then provide the ARN of the rule group in this statement.

You cannot nest a `RuleGroupReferenceStatement` , for example for use inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You cannot use a rule group reference statement inside another rule group. You can only reference a rule group as a top-level statement within a rule that you define in a web ACL.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

ExcludedRules -> (list)

Rules in the referenced rule group whose actions are set to `Count` .

### Note

Instead of this option, use `RuleActionOverrides` . It accepts any valid action setting, including `Count` .

(structure)

Specifies a single rule in a rule group whose action you want to override to `Count` .

### Note

Instead of this option, use `RuleActionOverrides` . It accepts any valid action setting, including `Count` .

Name -> (string)

The name of the rule whose action you want to override to `Count` .

RuleActionOverrides -> (list)

Action settings to use in the place of the rule actions that are configured inside the rule group. You specify one override for each rule whose action you want to change.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

You can use overrides for testing, for example you can override all of rule actions to `Count` and then monitor the resulting count metrics to understand how the rule group would handle your web traffic. You can also permanently override some or all actions, to modify how the rule group manages your web traffic.

(structure)

Action setting to use in the place of a rule action that is configured inside the rule group. You specify one override for each rule whose action you want to change.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

You can use overrides for testing, for example you can override all of rule actions to `Count` and then monitor the resulting count metrics to understand how the rule group would handle your web traffic. You can also permanently override some or all actions, to modify how the rule group manages your web traffic.

Name -> (string)

The name of the rule to override.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

ActionToUse -> (structure)

The override action to use, in place of the configured action of the rule in the rule group.

Block -> (structure)

Instructs WAF to block the web request.

CustomResponse -> (structure)

ResponseCode -> (integer)

The HTTP status code to return to the client.

For a list of status codes that you can use in your custom responses, see [Supported status codes for custom response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/customizing-the-response-status-codes.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)

References the response body that you want WAF to return to the web request client. You can define a custom response for a rule action or a default web ACL action that is set to block. To do this, you first define the response body key and value in the `CustomResponseBodies` setting for the  WebACL or  RuleGroup where you want to use it. Then, in the rule action or web ACL default action `BlockAction` setting, you reference the response body using this key.

ResponseHeaders -> (list)

The HTTP headers to use in the response. You can specify any header name except for `content-type` . Duplicate header names are not allowed.

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to detect web requests coming from particular IP addresses or address ranges. To use this, create an  IPSet that specifies the addresses you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this statement. To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

Each IP set rule statement references an IP set. You create and maintain the set independent of your rules. This allows you to use the single set in multiple rules. When you update the referenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules that reference it.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  IPSet that this statement references.

IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Position -> (string)

The position in the header to search for the IP address. The header can contain IP addresses of the original client and also of proxies. For example, the header value could be `10.1.1.1, 127.0.0.0, 10.10.10.10` where the first IP address identifies the original client and the rest identify proxies that the request went through.

The options for this setting are the following:

- FIRST - Inspect the first IP address in the list of IP addresses in the header. This is usually the clientâs original IP.
- LAST - Inspect the last IP address in the list of IP addresses in the header.
- ANY - Inspect all IP addresses in the header for a match. If the header contains more than 10 IP addresses, WAF inspects the last 10.

RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to search web request components for matches with regular expressions. To use this, create a  RegexPatternSet that specifies the expressions that you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this statement. A web request matches the pattern set rule statement if the request component matches any of the patterns in the set. To create a regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

Each regex pattern set rule statement references a regex pattern set. You create and maintain the set independent of your rules. This allows you to use the single set in multiple rules. When you update the referenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules that reference it.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  RegexPatternSet that this statement references.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

RateBasedStatement -> (structure)

A rate-based rule counts incoming requests and rate limits requests when they are coming at too fast a rate. The rule categorizes requests according to your aggregation criteria, collects them into aggregation instances, and counts and rate limits the requests for each instance.

### Note

If you change any of these settings in a rule thatâs currently in use, the change resets the ruleâs rate limiting counts. This can pause the ruleâs rate limiting activities for up to a minute.

You can specify individual aggregation keys, like IP address or HTTP method. You can also specify aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.

Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition.

For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP address and HTTP method values:

- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

The rule would create different aggregation instances according to your aggregation criteria, for example:

- If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each individual address is an aggregation instance, and WAF counts requests separately for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3
- IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1
- If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- HTTP method POST: count 2
- HTTP method GET: count 2
- If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2
- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1

For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which WAF counts and rate-limits individually.

You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.

You cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

For additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call `GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys` . This option is not available for other aggregation configurations.

WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF.

Limit -> (long)

The limit on requests during the specified evaluation window for a single aggregation instance for the rate-based rule. If the rate-based statement includes a `ScopeDownStatement` , this limit is applied only to the requests that match the statement.

Examples:

- If you aggregate on just the IP address, this is the limit on requests from any single IP address.
- If you aggregate on the HTTP method and the query argument name âcityâ, then this is the limit on requests for any single method, city pair.

EvaluationWindowSec -> (long)

The amount of time, in seconds, that WAF should include in its request counts, looking back from the current time. For example, for a setting of 120, when WAF checks the rate, it counts the requests for the 2 minutes immediately preceding the current time. Valid settings are 60, 120, 300, and 600.

This setting doesnât determine how often WAF checks the rate, but how far back it looks each time it checks. WAF checks the rate about every 10 seconds.

Default: `300` (5 minutes)

AggregateKeyType -> (string)

Setting that indicates how to aggregate the request counts.

### Note

Web requests that are missing any of the components specified in the aggregation keys are omitted from the rate-based rule evaluation and handling.

- `CONSTANT` - Count and limit the requests that match the rate-based ruleâs scope-down statement. With this option, the counted requests arenât further aggregated. The scope-down statement is the only specification used. When the count of all requests that satisfy the scope-down statement goes over the limit, WAF applies the rule action to all requests that satisfy the scope-down statement.  With this option, you must configure the `ScopeDownStatement` property.
- `CUSTOM_KEYS` - Aggregate the request counts using one or more web request components as the aggregate keys. With this option, you must specify the aggregate keys in the `CustomKeys` property.  To aggregate on only the IP address or only the forwarded IP address, donât use custom keys. Instead, set the aggregate key type to `IP` or `FORWARDED_IP` .
- `FORWARDED_IP` - Aggregate the request counts on the first IP address in an HTTP header.  With this option, you must specify the header to use in the `ForwardedIPConfig` property.  To aggregate on a combination of the forwarded IP address with other aggregate keys, use `CUSTOM_KEYS` .
- `IP` - Aggregate the request counts on the IP address from the web request origin. To aggregate on a combination of the IP address with other aggregate keys, use `CUSTOM_KEYS` .

( â¦ recursive â¦ )ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

This is required if you specify a forwarded IP in the ruleâs aggregate key settings.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

CustomKeys -> (list)

Specifies the aggregate keys to use in a rate-base rule.

### Note

Response inspection is available only in web ACLs that protect Amazon CloudFront distributions.

The ATP rule group evaluates the responses that your protected resources send back to client login attempts, keeping count of successful and failed attempts for each IP address and client session.

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to run the rules that are defined in a managed rule group. To use this, provide the vendor name and the name of the rule group in this statement. You can retrieve the required names by calling  ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups .

You cannot nest a `ManagedRuleGroupStatement` , for example for use inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You cannot use a managed rule group inside another rule group. You can only reference a managed rule group as a top-level statement within a rule that you define in a web ACL.

### Note

You are charged additional fees when you use the WAF Bot Control managed rule group `AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet` , the WAF Fraud Control account takeover prevention (ATP) managed rule group `AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet` , or the WAF Fraud Control account creation fraud prevention (ACFP) managed rule group `AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet` . For more information, see [WAF Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/waf/pricing/) .

VendorName -> (string)

The name of the managed rule group vendor. You use this, along with the rule group name, to identify a rule group.

Name -> (string)

The name of the managed rule group. You use this, along with the vendor name, to identify the rule group.

Version -> (string)

The version of the managed rule group to use. If you specify this, the version setting is fixed until you change it. If you donât specify this, WAF uses the vendorâs default version, and then keeps the version at the vendorâs default when the vendor updates the managed rule group settings.

ExcludedRules -> (list)

Rules in the referenced rule group whose actions are set to `Count` .

### Note

Instead of this option, use `RuleActionOverrides` . It accepts any valid action setting, including `Count` .

(structure)

Specifies a single rule in a rule group whose action you want to override to `Count` .

### Note

Instead of this option, use `RuleActionOverrides` . It accepts any valid action setting, including `Count` .

Name -> (string)

The name of the rule whose action you want to override to `Count` .

ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)

An optional nested statement that narrows the scope of the web requests that are evaluated by the managed rule group. Requests are only evaluated by the rule group if they match the scope-down statement. You can use any nestable  Statement in the scope-down statement, and you can nest statements at any level, the same as you can for a rule statement.

ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that defines a string match search for WAF to apply to web requests. The byte match statement provides the bytes to search for, the location in requests that you want WAF to search, and other settings. The bytes to search for are typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters. In the WAF console and the developer guide, this is called a string match statement.

SearchString -> (blob)

A string value that you want WAF to search for. WAF searches only in the part of web requests that you designate for inspection in  FieldToMatch . The maximum length of the value is 200 bytes.

Valid values depend on the component that you specify for inspection in `FieldToMatch` :

- `Method` : The HTTP method that you want WAF to search for. This indicates the type of operation specified in the request.
- `UriPath` : The value that you want WAF to search for in the URI path, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .
- `JA3Fingerprint` : Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .  You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .
- `HeaderOrder` : The list of header names to match for. WAF creates a string that contains the ordered list of header names, from the headers in the web request, and then matches against that string.

If `SearchString` includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.

**If youâre using the WAF API**

Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

For example, suppose the value of `Type` is `HEADER` and the value of `Data` is `User-Agent` . If you want to search the `User-Agent` header for the value `BadBot` , you base64-encode `BadBot` using MIME base64-encoding and include the resulting value, `QmFkQm90` , in the value of `SearchString` .

**If youâre using the CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs**

The value that you want WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers.

- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

PositionalConstraint -> (string)

The area within the portion of the web request that you want WAF to search for `SearchString` . Valid values include the following:

**CONTAINS**

The specified part of the web request must include the value of `SearchString` , but the location doesnât matter.

**CONTAINS_WORD**

The specified part of the web request must include the value of `SearchString` , and `SearchString` must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _). In addition, `SearchString` must be a word, which means that both of the following are true:

- `SearchString` is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request or is preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_). Examples include the value of a header and `;BadBot` .
- `SearchString` is at the end of the specified part of the web request or is followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, `BadBot;` and `-BadBot;` .

**EXACTLY**

The value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of `SearchString` .

**STARTS_WITH**

The value of `SearchString` must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the web request.

**ENDS_WITH**

The value of `SearchString` must appear at the end of the specified part of the web request.

SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that inspects for malicious SQL code. Attackers insert malicious SQL code into web requests to do things like modify your database or extract data from it.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.

A rule statement that inspects for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. In XSS attacks, the attacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as a vehicle to inject malicious client-site scripts into other legitimate web browsers.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers.

- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that compares a number of bytes against the size of a request component, using a comparison operator, such as greater than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can use a size constraint statement to look for query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

If you configure WAF to inspect the request body, WAF inspects only the number of bytes in the body up to the limit for the web ACL and protected resource type. If you know that the request body for your web requests should never exceed the inspection limit, you can use a size constraint statement to block requests that have a larger request body size. For more information about the inspection limits, see `Body` and `JsonBody` settings for the `FieldToMatch` data type.

If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI counts as one character. For example, the URI `/logo.jpg` is nine characters long.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available cookies normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

ComparisonOperator -> (string)

The operator to use to compare the request part to the size setting.

Size -> (long)

The size, in byte, to compare to the request part, after any transformations.

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement that labels web requests by country and region and that matches against web requests based on country code. A geo match rule labels every request that it inspects regardless of whether it finds a match.

- To manage requests only by country, you can use this statement by itself and specify the countries that you want to match against in the `CountryCodes` array.
- Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with Count action so that it only labels requests. Then, add one or more label match rules to run after the geo match rule and configure them to match against the geographic labels and handle the requests as needed.

WAF labels requests using the alpha-2 country and region codes from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 standard. WAF determines the codes using either the IP address in the web request origin or, if you specify it, the address in the geo match `ForwardedIPConfig` .

If you use the web request origin, the label formats are `awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO region code>` and `awswaf:clientip:geo:country:<ISO country code>` .

If you use a forwarded IP address, the label formats are `awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO region code>` and `awswaf:forwardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code>` .

For additional details, see [Geographic match rule statement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-type-geo-match.html) in the [WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) .

CountryCodes -> (list)

An array of two-character country codes that you want to match against, for example, `[ "US", "CN" ]` , from the alpha-2 country ISO codes of the ISO 3166 international standard.

When you use a geo match statement just for the region and country labels that it adds to requests, you still have to supply a country code for the rule to evaluate. In this case, you configure the rule to only count matching requests, but it will still generate logging and count metrics for any matches. You can reduce the logging and metrics that the rule produces by specifying a country thatâs unlikely to be a source of traffic to your site.

(string)

ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to run the rules that are defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a rule group with your rules, then provide the ARN of the rule group in this statement.

You cannot nest a `RuleGroupReferenceStatement` , for example for use inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You cannot use a rule group reference statement inside another rule group. You can only reference a rule group as a top-level statement within a rule that you define in a web ACL.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

ExcludedRules -> (list)

Rules in the referenced rule group whose actions are set to `Count` .

### Note

Instead of this option, use `RuleActionOverrides` . It accepts any valid action setting, including `Count` .

(structure)

Specifies a single rule in a rule group whose action you want to override to `Count` .

### Note

Instead of this option, use `RuleActionOverrides` . It accepts any valid action setting, including `Count` .

Name -> (string)

The name of the rule whose action you want to override to `Count` .

RuleActionOverrides -> (list)

Action settings to use in the place of the rule actions that are configured inside the rule group. You specify one override for each rule whose action you want to change.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

You can use overrides for testing, for example you can override all of rule actions to `Count` and then monitor the resulting count metrics to understand how the rule group would handle your web traffic. You can also permanently override some or all actions, to modify how the rule group manages your web traffic.

(structure)

Action setting to use in the place of a rule action that is configured inside the rule group. You specify one override for each rule whose action you want to change.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

You can use overrides for testing, for example you can override all of rule actions to `Count` and then monitor the resulting count metrics to understand how the rule group would handle your web traffic. You can also permanently override some or all actions, to modify how the rule group manages your web traffic.

Name -> (string)

The name of the rule to override.

### Note

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a rule name that doesnât match the name of any rule in the rule group, WAF doesnât return an error and doesnât apply the override setting.

ActionToUse -> (structure)

The override action to use, in place of the configured action of the rule in the rule group.

Block -> (structure)

Instructs WAF to block the web request.

CustomResponse -> (structure)

Defines a custom response for the web request.

For information about customizing web requests and responses, see [Customizing web requests and responses in WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-custom-request-response.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

ResponseCode -> (integer)

The HTTP status code to return to the client.

For a list of status codes that you can use in your custom responses, see [Supported status codes for custom response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/customizing-the-response-status-codes.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)

References the response body that you want WAF to return to the web request client. You can define a custom response for a rule action or a default web ACL action that is set to block. To do this, you first define the response body key and value in the `CustomResponseBodies` setting for the  WebACL or  RuleGroup where you want to use it. Then, in the rule action or web ACL default action `BlockAction` setting, you reference the response body using this key.

ResponseHeaders -> (list)

The HTTP headers to use in the response. You can specify any header name except for `content-type` . Duplicate header names are not allowed.

For information about the limits on count and size for custom request and response settings, see [WAF quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/limits.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

(structure)

A custom header for custom request and response handling. This is used in  CustomResponse and  CustomRequestHandling .

Name -> (string)

The name of the custom header.

For custom request header insertion, when WAF inserts the header into the request, it prefixes this name `x-amzn-waf-` , to avoid confusion with the headers that are already in the request. For example, for the header name `sample` , WAF inserts the header `x-amzn-waf-sample` .

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

Allow -> (structure)

Instructs WAF to allow the web request.

CustomRequestHandling -> (structure)

Defines custom handling for the web request.

For information about customizing web requests and responses, see [Customizing web requests and responses in WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-custom-request-response.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to detect web requests coming from particular IP addresses or address ranges. To use this, create an  IPSet that specifies the addresses you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this statement. To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

Each IP set rule statement references an IP set. You create and maintain the set independent of your rules. This allows you to use the single set in multiple rules. When you update the referenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules that reference it.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  IPSet that this statement references.

IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Position -> (string)

The position in the header to search for the IP address. The header can contain IP addresses of the original client and also of proxies. For example, the header value could be `10.1.1.1, 127.0.0.0, 10.10.10.10` where the first IP address identifies the original client and the rest identify proxies that the request went through.

The options for this setting are the following:

- FIRST - Inspect the first IP address in the list of IP addresses in the header. This is usually the clientâs original IP.
- LAST - Inspect the last IP address in the list of IP addresses in the header.
- ANY - Inspect all IP addresses in the header for a match. If the header contains more than 10 IP addresses, WAF inspects the last 10.

RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to search web request components for matches with regular expressions. To use this, create a  RegexPatternSet that specifies the expressions that you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this statement. A web request matches the pattern set rule statement if the request component matches any of the patterns in the set. To create a regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

Each regex pattern set rule statement references a regex pattern set. You create and maintain the set independent of your rules. This allows you to use the single set in multiple rules. When you update the referenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules that reference it.

ARN -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  RegexPatternSet that this statement references.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available cookies normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

RateBasedStatement -> (structure)

A rate-based rule counts incoming requests and rate limits requests when they are coming at too fast a rate. The rule categorizes requests according to your aggregation criteria, collects them into aggregation instances, and counts and rate limits the requests for each instance.

### Note

If you change any of these settings in a rule thatâs currently in use, the change resets the ruleâs rate limiting counts. This can pause the ruleâs rate limiting activities for up to a minute.

You can specify individual aggregation keys, like IP address or HTTP method. You can also specify aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.

Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition.

For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP address and HTTP method values:

- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

The rule would create different aggregation instances according to your aggregation criteria, for example:

- If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each individual address is an aggregation instance, and WAF counts requests separately for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3
- IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1
- If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- HTTP method POST: count 2
- HTTP method GET: count 2
- If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1
- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2
- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1

For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which WAF counts and rate-limits individually.

You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.

You cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

For additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call `GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys` . This option is not available for other aggregation configurations.

WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF.

Limit -> (long)

The limit on requests during the specified evaluation window for a single aggregation instance for the rate-based rule. If the rate-based statement includes a `ScopeDownStatement` , this limit is applied only to the requests that match the statement.

Examples:

- If you aggregate on just the IP address, this is the limit on requests from any single IP address.
- If you aggregate on the HTTP method and the query argument name âcityâ, then this is the limit on requests for any single method, city pair.

EvaluationWindowSec -> (long)

The amount of time, in seconds, that WAF should include in its request counts, looking back from the current time. For example, for a setting of 120, when WAF checks the rate, it counts the requests for the 2 minutes immediately preceding the current time. Valid settings are 60, 120, 300, and 600.

This setting doesnât determine how often WAF checks the rate, but how far back it looks each time it checks. WAF checks the rate about every 10 seconds.

Default: `300` (5 minutes)

AggregateKeyType -> (string)

Setting that indicates how to aggregate the request counts.

### Note

Web requests that are missing any of the components specified in the aggregation keys are omitted from the rate-based rule evaluation and handling.

- `CONSTANT` - Count and limit the requests that match the rate-based ruleâs scope-down statement. With this option, the counted requests arenât further aggregated. The scope-down statement is the only specification used. When the count of all requests that satisfy the scope-down statement goes over the limit, WAF applies the rule action to all requests that satisfy the scope-down statement.  With this option, you must configure the `ScopeDownStatement` property.
- `CUSTOM_KEYS` - Aggregate the request counts using one or more web request components as the aggregate keys. With this option, you must specify the aggregate keys in the `CustomKeys` property.  To aggregate on only the IP address or only the forwarded IP address, donât use custom keys. Instead, set the aggregate key type to `IP` or `FORWARDED_IP` .
- `FORWARDED_IP` - Aggregate the request counts on the first IP address in an HTTP header.  With this option, you must specify the header to use in the `ForwardedIPConfig` property.  To aggregate on a combination of the forwarded IP address with other aggregate keys, use `CUSTOM_KEYS` .
- `IP` - Aggregate the request counts on the IP address from the web request origin. To aggregate on a combination of the IP address with other aggregate keys, use `CUSTOM_KEYS` .

( â¦ recursive â¦ )ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address thatâs reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

This is required if you specify a forwarded IP in the ruleâs aggregate key settings.

HeaderName -> (string)

The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address. For example, to use the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, set this to `X-Forwarded-For` .

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a valid IP address in the specified position.

### Note

If the specified header isnât present in the request, WAF doesnât apply the rule to the web request at all.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

CustomKeys -> (list)

Specifies the aggregate keys to use in a rate-base rule.

(structure)

### Note

Web requests that are missing any of the components specified in the aggregation keys are omitted from the rate-based rule evaluation and handling.

Header -> (structure)

Use the value of a header in the request as an aggregate key. Each distinct value in the header contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use a single header as your custom key, then each value fully defines an aggregation instance.

HTTPMethod -> (structure)

Use the requestâs HTTP method as an aggregate key. Each distinct HTTP method contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just the HTTP method as your custom key, then each method fully defines an aggregation instance.

ForwardedIP -> (structure)

Use the first IP address in an HTTP header as an aggregate key. Each distinct forwarded IP address contributes to the aggregation instance.

When you specify an IP or forwarded IP in the custom key settings, you must also specify at least one other key to use. You can aggregate on only the forwarded IP address by specifying `FORWARDED_IP` in your rate-based statementâs `AggregateKeyType` .

With this option, you must specify the header to use in the rate-based ruleâs `ForwardedIPConfig` property.

IP -> (structure)

Use the requestâs originating IP address as an aggregate key. Each distinct IP address contributes to the aggregation instance.

When you specify an IP or forwarded IP in the custom key settings, you must also specify at least one other key to use. You can aggregate on only the IP address by specifying `IP` in your rate-based statementâs `AggregateKeyType` .

LabelNamespace -> (structure)

Use the specified label namespace as an aggregate key. Each distinct fully qualified label name that has the specified label namespace contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just one label namespace as your custom key, then each label name fully defines an aggregation instance.

This uses only labels that have been added to the request by rules that are evaluated before this rate-based rule in the web ACL.

For information about label namespaces and names, see [Label syntax and naming requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-label-requirements.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Namespace -> (string)

The namespace to use for aggregation.

UriPath -> (structure)

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if there is insufficient TSL Client Hello information to compute the JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Use the requestâs JA4 fingerprint as an aggregate key. If you use a single JA4 fingerprint as your custom key, then each value fully defines an aggregation instance.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

( â¦ recursive â¦ )

ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to run the rules that are defined in a managed rule group. To use this, provide the vendor name and the name of the rule group in this statement. You can retrieve the required names by calling  ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups .

You cannot nest a `ManagedRuleGroupStatement` , for example for use inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You cannot use a managed rule group inside another rule group. You can only reference a managed rule group as a top-level statement within a rule that you define in a web ACL.

### Note

You are charged additional fees when you use the WAF Bot Control managed rule group `AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet` , the WAF Fraud Control account takeover prevention (ATP) managed rule group `AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet` , or the WAF Fraud Control account creation fraud prevention (ACFP) managed rule group `AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet` . For more information, see [WAF Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/waf/pricing/) .

Name -> (string)

The name of the managed rule group. You use this, along with the vendor name, to identify the rule group.

Version -> (string)

The version of the managed rule group to use. If you specify this, the version setting is fixed until you change it. If you donât specify this, WAF uses the vendorâs default version, and then keeps the version at the vendorâs default when the vendor updates the managed rule group settings.

ExcludedRules -> (list)

Rules in the referenced rule group whose actions are set to `Count` .

### Note

Instead of this option, use `RuleActionOverrides` . It accepts any valid action setting, including `Count` .

For information about customizing web requests and responses, see [Customizing web requests and responses in WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-custom-request-response.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

ResponseCode -> (integer)

The HTTP status code to return to the client.

For a list of status codes that you can use in your custom responses, see [Supported status codes for custom response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/customizing-the-response-status-codes.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)

References the response body that you want WAF to return to the web request client. You can define a custom response for a rule action or a default web ACL action that is set to block. To do this, you first define the response body key and value in the `CustomResponseBodies` setting for the  WebACL or  RuleGroup where you want to use it. Then, in the rule action or web ACL default action `BlockAction` setting, you reference the response body using this key.

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement to match against labels that have been added to the web request by rules that have already run in the web ACL.

The label match statement provides the label or namespace string to search for. The label string can represent a part or all of the fully qualified label name that had been added to the web request. Fully qualified labels have a prefix, optional namespaces, and label name. The prefix identifies the rule group or web ACL context of the rule that added the label. If you do not provide the fully qualified name in your label match string, WAF performs the search for labels that were added in the same context as the label match statement.

Scope -> (string)

Specify whether you want to match using the label name or just the namespace.

Key -> (string)

The string to match against. The setting you provide for this depends on the match statementâs `Scope` setting:

- If the `Scope` indicates `LABEL` , then this specification must include the name and can include any number of preceding namespace specifications and prefix up to providing the fully qualified label name.
- If the `Scope` indicates `NAMESPACE` , then this specification can include any number of contiguous namespace strings, and can include the entire label namespace prefix from the rule group or web ACL where the label originates.

Labels are case sensitive and components of a label must be separated by colon, for example `NS1:NS2:name` .

RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to search web request components for a match against a single regular expression.

RegexString -> (string)

The string representing the regular expression.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available cookies normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

For information about customizing web requests and responses, see [Customizing web requests and responses in WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-custom-request-response.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

InsertHeaders -> (list)

The HTTP headers to insert into the request. Duplicate header names are not allowed.

For information about the limits on count and size for custom request and response settings, see [WAF quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/limits.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

(structure)

A custom header for custom request and response handling. This is used in  CustomResponse and  CustomRequestHandling .

Name -> (string)

The name of the custom header.

For custom request header insertion, when WAF inserts the header into the request, it prefixes this name `x-amzn-waf-` , to avoid confusion with the headers that are already in the request. For example, for the header name `sample` , WAF inserts the header `x-amzn-waf-sample` .

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

Challenge -> (structure)

Instructs WAF to run a `Challenge` check against the web request.

CustomRequestHandling -> (structure)

Defines custom handling for the web request, used when the challenge inspection determines that the requestâs token is valid and unexpired.

For information about customizing web requests and responses, see [Customizing web requests and responses in WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-custom-request-response.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

InsertHeaders -> (list)

The HTTP headers to insert into the request. Duplicate header names are not allowed.

For information about the limits on count and size for custom request and response settings, see [WAF quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/limits.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

(structure)

A custom header for custom request and response handling. This is used in  CustomResponse and  CustomRequestHandling .

Name -> (string)

The name of the custom header.

For custom request header insertion, when WAF inserts the header into the request, it prefixes this name `x-amzn-waf-` , to avoid confusion with the headers that are already in the request. For example, for the header name `sample` , WAF inserts the header `x-amzn-waf-sample` .

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement to match against labels that have been added to the web request by rules that have already run in the web ACL.

The label match statement provides the label or namespace string to search for. The label string can represent a part or all of the fully qualified label name that had been added to the web request. Fully qualified labels have a prefix, optional namespaces, and label name. The prefix identifies the rule group or web ACL context of the rule that added the label. If you do not provide the fully qualified name in your label match string, WAF performs the search for labels that were added in the same context as the label match statement.

Scope -> (string)

Specify whether you want to match using the label name or just the namespace.

Key -> (string)

The string to match against. The setting you provide for this depends on the match statementâs `Scope` setting:

- If the `Scope` indicates `LABEL` , then this specification must include the name and can include any number of preceding namespace specifications and prefix up to providing the fully qualified label name.
- If the `Scope` indicates `NAMESPACE` , then this specification can include any number of contiguous namespace strings, and can include the entire label namespace prefix from the rule group or web ACL where the label originates.

Labels are case sensitive and components of a label must be separated by colon, for example `NS1:NS2:name` .

RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)

A rule statement used to search web request components for a match against a single regular expression.

RegexString -> (string)

The string representing the regular expression.

FieldToMatch -> (structure)

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.

SingleHeader -> (structure)

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` . This setting isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`

Alternately, you can filter and inspect all headers with the `Headers` `FieldToMatch` setting.

Name -> (string)

The name of the query header to inspect.

SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isnât case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`

Name -> (string)

The name of the query argument to inspect.

AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

Inspect all query arguments.

UriPath -> (structure)

Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .

QueryString -> (structure)

Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.

Body -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `Body` object configuration.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Method -> (structure)

Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.

JsonBody -> (structure)

Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the `JsonBody` object configuration.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.

All -> (structure)

Match all of the elements. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

You must specify either this setting or the `IncludedPaths` setting, but not both.

IncludedPaths -> (list)

Match only the specified include paths. See also `MatchScope` in  JsonBody .

Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]` . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) .

You must specify either this setting or the `All` setting, but not both.

### Note

Donât use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the `All` setting.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the JSON to match against using the `MatchPattern` . If you specify `ALL` , WAF matches against keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

- For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
- For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
- For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: `CONTINUE`

Headers -> (structure)

Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Headers` object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the `Headers` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedHeaders` , or `ExcludedHeaders` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all headers.

IncludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedHeaders -> (list)

Inspect only the headers whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

Cookies -> (structure)

Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `Cookies` object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the `Cookies` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

MatchPattern -> (structure)

The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either `All` , `IncludedCookies` , or `ExcludedCookies` .

Example JSON: `"MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }`

All -> (structure)

Inspect all cookies.

IncludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.

(string)

ExcludedCookies -> (list)

Inspect only the cookies whose keys donât match any of the strings specified here.

(string)

MatchScope -> (string)

The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `ALL` , WAF inspects both keys and values.

`All` does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values, use a logical `AND` statement to combine two match rules, one that inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the cookies of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available cookies normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

HeaderOrder -> (structure)

Inspect a string containing the list of the requestâs header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer` .

OversizeHandling -> (string)

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

- `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA3 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

JA4Fingerprint -> (structure)

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. Match against the requestâs JA4 fingerprint. The JA4 fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the clientâs TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this information.

### Note

You can use this choice only with a string match `ByteMatchStatement` with the `PositionalConstraint` set to `EXACTLY` .

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For information about the logging fields, see [Log fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesnât have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

UriFragment -> (structure)

Inspect fragments of the request URI. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the `UriFragment` object, to define the fragment of a URI that WAF inspects.

Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a requestâs URI fragments and only the first 200 URI fragments are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize URI fragment content in the `UriFragment` object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.

FallbackBehavior -> (string)

What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:

- `EVALUATE_AS_STRING` - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
- `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.
- `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

If you donât provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

Example JSON: `{ "UriFragment": { "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"} }`

### Note

WAF parsing doesnât fully validate the input JSON string, so parsing can succeed even for invalid JSON. When parsing succeeds, WAF doesnât apply the fallback behavior. For more information, see [JSON body](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields-list.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component-json-body) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

TextTransformations -> (list)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and theyâre used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.

(structure)

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.

Priority -> (integer)

Sets the relative processing order for multiple transformations. WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content. The priorities donât need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.

Type -> (string)

For detailed descriptions of each of the transformation types, see [Text transformations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-transformation.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Action -> (structure)

The action that WAF should take on a web request when it matches the rule statement. Settings at the web ACL level can override the rule action setting.

This is used only for rules whose statements do not reference a rule group. Rule statements that reference a rule group include `RuleGroupReferenceStatement` and `ManagedRuleGroupStatement` .

You must specify either this `Action` setting or the rule `OverrideAction` setting, but not both:

- If the rule statement does not reference a rule group, use this rule action setting and not the rule override action setting.
- If the rule statement references a rule group, use the override action setting and not this action setting.

Block -> (structure)

Instructs WAF to block the web request.

CustomResponse -> (structure)

Defines a custom response for the web request.

For information about customizing web requests and responses, see [Customizing web requests and responses in WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-custom-request-response.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

ResponseCode -> (integer)

The HTTP status code to return to the client.

For a list of status codes that you can use in your custom responses, see [Supported status codes for custom response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/customizing-the-response-status-codes.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)

References the response body that you want WAF to return to the web request client. You can define a custom response for a rule action or a default web ACL action that is set to block. To do this, you first define the response body key and value in the `CustomResponseBodies` setting for the  WebACL or  RuleGroup where you want to use it. Then, in the rule action or web ACL default action `BlockAction` setting, you reference the response body using this key.

ResponseHeaders -> (list)

The HTTP headers to use in the response. You can specify any header name except for `content-type` . Duplicate header names are not allowed.

(structure)

A custom header for custom request and response handling. This is used in  CustomResponse and  CustomRequestHandling .

Name -> (string)

The name of the custom header.

For custom request header insertion, when WAF inserts the header into the request, it prefixes this name `x-amzn-waf-` , to avoid confusion with the headers that are already in the request. For example, for the header name `sample` , WAF inserts the header `x-amzn-waf-sample` .

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

Allow -> (structure)

Instructs WAF to allow the web request.

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

OverrideAction -> (structure)

The action to use in the place of the action that results from the rule group evaluation. Set the override action to none to leave the result of the rule group alone. Set it to count to override the result to count only.

You can only use this for rule statements that reference a rule group, like `RuleGroupReferenceStatement` and `ManagedRuleGroupStatement` .

### Note

This option is usually set to none. It does not affect how the rules in the rule group are evaluated. If you want the rules in the rule group to only count matches, do not use this and instead use the rule action override option, with `Count` action, in your rule group reference statement settings.

CustomRequestHandling -> (structure)

Defines custom handling for the web request.

For information about customizing web requests and responses, see [Customizing web requests and responses in WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-custom-request-response.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

InsertHeaders -> (list)

The HTTP headers to insert into the request. Duplicate header names are not allowed.

For information about the limits on count and size for custom request and response settings, see [WAF quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/limits.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

(structure)

A custom header for custom request and response handling. This is used in  CustomResponse and  CustomRequestHandling .

Name -> (string)

The name of the custom header.

For custom request header insertion, when WAF inserts the header into the request, it prefixes this name `x-amzn-waf-` , to avoid confusion with the headers that are already in the request. For example, for the header name `sample` , WAF inserts the header `x-amzn-waf-sample` .

Value -> (string)

The value of the custom header.

None -> (structure)

Donât override the rule group evaluation result. This is the most common setting.

RuleLabels -> (list)

Labels to apply to web requests that match the rule match statement. WAF applies fully qualified labels to matching web requests. A fully qualified label is the concatenation of a label namespace and a rule label. The ruleâs rule group or web ACL defines the label namespace.

### Note

Any rule that isnât a rule group reference statement or managed rule group statement can add labels to matching web requests.

Rules that run after this rule in the web ACL can match against these labels using a `LabelMatchStatement` .

For each label, provide a case-sensitive string containing optional namespaces and a label name, according to the following guidelines:

- Separate each component of the label with a colon.
- Each namespace or name can have up to 128 characters.
- You can specify up to 5 namespaces in a label.
- Donât use the following reserved words in your label specification: `aws` , `waf` , `managed` , `rulegroup` , `webacl` , `regexpatternset` , or `ipset` .

For example, `myLabelName` or `nameSpace1:nameSpace2:myLabelName` .

(structure)

A single label container. This is used as an element of a label array in multiple contexts, for example, in `RuleLabels` inside a  Rule and in `Labels` inside a  SampledHTTPRequest .

Name -> (string)

The label string.

VisibilityConfig -> (structure)

Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request sample collection.

If you change the name of a `Rule` after you create it and you want the ruleâs metric name to reflect the change, update the metric name as well. WAF doesnât automatically update the metric name.

SampledRequestsEnabled -> (boolean)

Indicates whether WAF should store a sampling of the web requests that match the rules. You can view the sampled requests through the WAF console.

If you configure data protection for the web ACL, the protection applies to the web ACLâs sampled web request data.

### Note

Request sampling doesnât provide a field redaction option, and any field redaction that you specify in your logging configuration doesnât affect sampling. You can only exclude fields from request sampling by disabling sampling in the web ACL visibility configuration or by configuring data protection for the web ACL.

CloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)

Indicates whether the associated resource sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. For the list of available metrics, see [WAF Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html#waf-metrics) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

For web ACLs, the metrics are for web requests that have the web ACL default action applied. WAF applies the default action to web requests that pass the inspection of all rules in the web ACL without being either allowed or blocked. For more information, see [The web ACL default action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-default-action.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

MetricName -> (string)

A name of the Amazon CloudWatch metric dimension. The name can contain only the characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, - (hyphen), and _ (underscore). The name can be from one to 128 characters long. It canât contain whitespace or metric names that are reserved for WAF, for example `All` and `Default_Action` .

CaptchaConfig -> (structure)

Specifies how WAF should handle `CAPTCHA` evaluations. If you donât specify this, WAF uses the `CAPTCHA` configuration thatâs defined for the web ACL.

ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)

Determines how long a `CAPTCHA` timestamp in the token remains valid after the client successfully solves a `CAPTCHA` puzzle.

ImmunityTime -> (long)

The amount of time, in seconds, that a `CAPTCHA` or challenge timestamp is considered valid by WAF. The default setting is 300.

For the Challenge action, the minimum setting is 300.

ChallengeConfig -> (structure)

Specifies how WAF should handle `Challenge` evaluations. If you donât specify this, WAF uses the challenge configuration thatâs defined for the web ACL.

ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)

Determines how long a challenge timestamp in the token remains valid after the client successfully responds to a challenge.

ImmunityTime -> (long)

The amount of time, in seconds, that a `CAPTCHA` or challenge timestamp is considered valid by WAF. The default setting is 300.

For the Challenge action, the minimum setting is 300.

`--visibility-config` (structure)

Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request sample collection.

SampledRequestsEnabled -> (boolean)

Indicates whether WAF should store a sampling of the web requests that match the rules. You can view the sampled requests through the WAF console.

If you configure data protection for the web ACL, the protection applies to the web ACLâs sampled web request data.

### Note

Request sampling doesnât provide a field redaction option, and any field redaction that you specify in your logging configuration doesnât affect sampling. You can only exclude fields from request sampling by disabling sampling in the web ACL visibility configuration or by configuring data protection for the web ACL.

CloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)

Indicates whether the associated resource sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. For the list of available metrics, see [WAF Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html#waf-metrics) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

For web ACLs, the metrics are for web requests that have the web ACL default action applied. WAF applies the default action to web requests that pass the inspection of all rules in the web ACL without being either allowed or blocked. For more information, see [The web ACL default action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-default-action.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

MetricName -> (string)

A name of the Amazon CloudWatch metric dimension. The name can contain only the characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, - (hyphen), and _ (underscore). The name can be from one to 128 characters long. It canât contain whitespace or metric names that are reserved for WAF, for example `All` and `Default_Action` .

Shorthand Syntax:

```
SampledRequestsEnabled=boolean,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=boolean,MetricName=string
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{
  "SampledRequestsEnabled": true|false,
  "CloudWatchMetricsEnabled": true|false,
  "MetricName": "string"
}
```

`--data-protection-config` (structure)

Specifies data protection to apply to the web request data for the web ACL. This is a web ACL level data protection option.

The data protection that you configure for the web ACL alters the data thatâs available for any other data collection activity, including your WAF logging destinations, web ACL request sampling, and Amazon Security Lake data collection and management. Your other option for data protection is in the logging configuration, which only affects logging.

DataProtections -> (list)

An array of data protection configurations for specific web request field types. This is defined for each web ACL. WAF applies the specified protection to all web requests that the web ACL inspects.

(structure)

Specifies the protection behavior for a field type. This is part of the data protection configuration for a web ACL.

Field -> (structure)

Specifies the field type and optional keys to apply the protection behavior to.

FieldType -> (string)

Specifies the web request component type to protect.

FieldKeys -> (list)

Specifies the keys to protect for the specified field type. If you donât specify any key, then all keys for the field type are protected.

(string)

Action -> (string)

Specifies how to protect the field. WAF can apply a one-way hash to the field or hard code a string substitution.

- One-way hash example: `ade099751dEXAMPLEHASH2ea9f3393f80dd5d3bEXAMPLEHASH966ae0d3cd5a1e`
- Substitution example: `REDACTED`

ExcludeRuleMatchDetails -> (boolean)

Specifies whether to also exclude any rule match details from the data protection you have enabled for a given field. WAF logs these details for non-terminating matching rules and for the terminating matching rule. For additional information, see [Log fields for web ACL traffic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Default: `FALSE`

ExcludeRateBasedDetails -> (boolean)

Specifies whether to also exclude any rate-based rule details from the data protection you have enabled for a given field. If you specify this exception, RateBasedDetails will show the value of the field. For additional information, see the log field `rateBasedRuleList` at [Log fields for web ACL traffic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Default: `FALSE`

JSON Syntax:

```
{
  "DataProtections": [
    {
      "Field": {
        "FieldType": "SINGLE_HEADER"|"SINGLE_COOKIE"|"SINGLE_QUERY_ARGUMENT"|"QUERY_STRING"|"BODY",
        "FieldKeys": ["string", ...]
      },
      "Action": "SUBSTITUTION"|"HASH",
      "ExcludeRuleMatchDetails": true|false,
      "ExcludeRateBasedDetails": true|false
    }
    ...
  ]
}
```

`--lock-token` (string)

A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your `get` and `list` requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like `update` and `delete` . WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a `WAFOptimisticLockException` . If this happens, perform another `get` , and use the new token returned by that operation.

`--custom-response-bodies` (map)

A map of custom response keys and content bodies. When you create a rule with a block action, you can send a custom response to the web request. You define these for the web ACL, and then use them in the rules and default actions that you define in the web ACL.

For information about customizing web requests and responses, see [Customizing web requests and responses in WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-custom-request-response.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

For information about the limits on count and size for custom request and response settings, see [WAF quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/limits.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

key -> (string)

value -> (structure)

The response body to use in a custom response to a web request. This is referenced by key from  CustomResponse  `CustomResponseBodyKey` .

ContentType -> (string)

The type of content in the payload that you are defining in the `Content` string.

Content -> (string)

The payload of the custom response.

You can use JSON escape strings in JSON content. To do this, you must specify JSON content in the `ContentType` setting.

For information about the limits on count and size for custom request and response settings, see [WAF quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/limits.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide* .

Shorthand Syntax:

```
KeyName1=ContentType=string,Content=string,KeyName2=ContentType=string,Content=string
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{"string": {
      "ContentType": "TEXT_PLAIN"|"TEXT_HTML"|"APPLICATION_JSON",
      "Content": "string"
    }
  ...}
```

`--captcha-config` (structure)

Specifies how WAF should handle `CAPTCHA` evaluations for rules that donât have their own `CaptchaConfig` settings. If you donât specify this, WAF uses its default settings for `CaptchaConfig` .

ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)

Determines how long a `CAPTCHA` timestamp in the token remains valid after the client successfully solves a `CAPTCHA` puzzle.

ImmunityTime -> (long)

The amount of time, in seconds, that a `CAPTCHA` or challenge timestamp is considered valid by WAF. The default setting is 300.

For the Challenge action, the minimum setting is 300.

Shorthand Syntax:

```
ImmunityTimeProperty={ImmunityTime=long}
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{
  "ImmunityTimeProperty": {
    "ImmunityTime": long
  }
}
```

`--challenge-config` (structure)

Specifies how WAF should handle challenge evaluations for rules that donât have their own `ChallengeConfig` settings. If you donât specify this, WAF uses its default settings for `ChallengeConfig` .

ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)

Determines how long a challenge timestamp in the token remains valid after the client successfully responds to a challenge.

ImmunityTime -> (long)

The amount of time, in seconds, that a `CAPTCHA` or challenge timestamp is considered valid by WAF. The default setting is 300.

For the Challenge action, the minimum setting is 300.

Shorthand Syntax:

```
ImmunityTimeProperty={ImmunityTime=long}
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{
  "ImmunityTimeProperty": {
    "ImmunityTime": long
  }
}
```

`--token-domains` (list)

Specifies the domains that WAF should accept in a web request token. This enables the use of tokens across multiple protected websites. When WAF provides a token, it uses the domain of the Amazon Web Services resource that the web ACL is protecting. If you donât specify a list of token domains, WAF accepts tokens only for the domain of the protected resource. With a token domain list, WAF accepts the resourceâs host domain plus all domains in the token domain list, including their prefixed subdomains.

Example JSON: `"TokenDomains": { "mywebsite.com", "myotherwebsite.com" }`

Public suffixes arenât allowed. For example, you canât use `gov.au` or `co.uk` as token domains.

(string)

Syntax:

```
"string" "string" ...
```

`--association-config` (structure)

Specifies custom configurations for the associations between the web ACL and protected resources.

Use this to customize the maximum size of the request body that your protected resources forward to WAF for inspection. You can customize this setting for CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, or Verified Access resources. The default setting is 16 KB (16,384 bytes).

### Note

You are charged additional fees when your protected resources forward body sizes that are larger than the default. For more information, see [WAF Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/waf/pricing/) .

For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).

RequestBody -> (map)

Customizes the maximum size of the request body that your protected CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access resources forward to WAF for inspection. The default size is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). You can change the setting for any of the available resource types.

### Note

You are charged additional fees when your protected resources forward body sizes that are larger than the default. For more information, see [WAF Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/waf/pricing/) .

Example JSON: `{ "API_GATEWAY": "KB_48", "APP_RUNNER_SERVICE": "KB_32" }`

For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).

key -> (string)

value -> (structure)

Customizes the maximum size of the request body that your protected CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access resources forward to WAF for inspection. The default size is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). You can change the setting for any of the available resource types.

### Note

You are charged additional fees when your protected resources forward body sizes that are larger than the default. For more information, see [WAF Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/waf/pricing/) .

Example JSON: `{ "API_GATEWAY": "KB_48", "APP_RUNNER_SERVICE": "KB_32" }`

For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).

This is used in the `AssociationConfig` of the web ACL.

DefaultSizeInspectionLimit -> (string)

Specifies the maximum size of the web request body component that an associated CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, or Verified Access resource should send to WAF for inspection. This applies to statements in the web ACL that inspect the body or JSON body.

Default: `16 KB (16,384 bytes)`

Shorthand Syntax:

```
RequestBody={KeyName1={DefaultSizeInspectionLimit=string},KeyName2={DefaultSizeInspectionLimit=string}}
```

JSON Syntax:

```
{
  "RequestBody": {"CLOUDFRONT"|"API_GATEWAY"|"COGNITO_USER_POOL"|"APP_RUNNER_SERVICE"|"VERIFIED_ACCESS_INSTANCE": {
        "DefaultSizeInspectionLimit": "KB_16"|"KB_32"|"KB_48"|"KB_64"
      }
    ...}
}
```

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To update a web ACL**

The following `update-web-acl` changes settings for an existing web ACL. This call requires an ID, which you can obtain from the call, `list-web-acls`, and a lock token and other settings, which you can obtain from the call `get-web-acl`. This call also returns a lock token that you can use for a subsequent update.

```
aws wafv2 update-web-acl \
    --name TestWebAcl \
    --scope REGIONAL \
    --id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
    --lock-token 2294b3a1-0000-0000-0000-a3ae04329de9 \
    --default-action Block={} \
    --visibility-config SampledRequestsEnabled=false,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=false,MetricName=NewMetricTestWebAcl \
    --rules file://waf-rule.json \
    --region us-west-2
```

Output:

```
{
    "NextLockToken": "714a0cfb-0000-0000-0000-2959c8b9a684"
}
```

For more information, see [Managing and Using a Web Access Control List (Web ACL)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl.html) in the *AWS WAF, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced Developer Guide*.

## Output

NextLockToken -> (string)

A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns this token to your `update` requests. You use `NextLockToken` in the same manner as you use `LockToken` .
