# list-frameworks

## Description

Returns a list of all frameworks for an Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web Services Region.

```

## Options

`--max-results` (integer)

The number of desired results from 1 to 1000. Optional. If unspecified, the query will return 1 MB of data.

`--next-token` (string)

An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this operation, which can be used to return the next set of items in the list.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

Frameworks -> (list)

The frameworks with details for each framework, including the framework name, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), description, number of controls, creation time, and deployment status.

(structure)

Contains detailed information about a framework. Frameworks contain controls, which evaluate and report on your backup events and resources. Frameworks generate daily compliance results.

FrameworkName -> (string)

The unique name of a framework. This name is between 1 and 256 characters, starting with a letter, and consisting of letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).

FrameworkArn -> (string)

An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a resource. The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.

FrameworkDescription -> (string)

An optional description of the framework with a maximum 1,024 characters.

NumberOfControls -> (integer)

The number of controls contained by the framework.

CreationTime -> (timestamp)

The date and time that a framework is created, in ISO 8601 representation. The value of `CreationTime` is accurate to milliseconds. For example, 2020-07-10T15:00:00.000-08:00 represents the 10th of July 2020 at 3:00 PM 8 hours behind UTC.

DeploymentStatus -> (string)

The deployment status of a framework. The statuses are:

`CREATE_IN_PROGRESS | UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS | DELETE_IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETED | FAILED`

NextToken -> (string)

An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this operation, which can be used to return the next set of items in the list.
