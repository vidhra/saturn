# put-backup-vault-lock-configuration

## Description

Applies Backup Vault Lock to a backup vault, preventing attempts to delete any recovery point stored in or created in a backup vault. Vault Lock also prevents attempts to update the lifecycle policy that controls the retention period of any recovery point currently stored in a backup vault. If specified, Vault Lock enforces a minimum and maximum retention period for future backup and copy jobs that target a backup vault.

### Note

Backup Vault Lock has been assessed by Cohasset Associates for use in environments that are subject to SEC 17a-4, CFTC, and FINRA regulations. For more information about how Backup Vault Lock relates to these regulations, see the [Cohasset Associates Compliance Assessment.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/samples/cohassetreport.zip)

## Options

`--backup-vault-name` (string)

The Backup Vault Lock configuration that specifies the name of the backup vault it protects.

`--min-retention-days` (long)

The Backup Vault Lock configuration that specifies the minimum retention period that the vault retains its recovery points. This setting can be useful if, for example, your organizationâs policies require you to retain certain data for at least seven years (2555 days).

This parameter is required when a vault lock is created through CloudFormation; otherwise, this parameter is optional. If this parameter is not specified, Vault Lock will not enforce a minimum retention period.

If this parameter is specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a lifecycle policy with a retention period equal to or longer than the minimum retention period. If the jobâs retention period is shorter than that minimum retention period, then the vault fails that backup or copy job, and you should either modify your lifecycle settings or use a different vault. The shortest minimum retention period you can specify is 1 day. Recovery points already saved in the vault prior to Vault Lock are not affected.

`--max-retention-days` (long)

The Backup Vault Lock configuration that specifies the maximum retention period that the vault retains its recovery points. This setting can be useful if, for example, your organizationâs policies require you to destroy certain data after retaining it for four years (1460 days).

If this parameter is not included, Vault Lock does not enforce a maximum retention period on the recovery points in the vault. If this parameter is included without a value, Vault Lock will not enforce a maximum retention period.

If this parameter is specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a lifecycle policy with a retention period equal to or shorter than the maximum retention period. If the jobâs retention period is longer than that maximum retention period, then the vault fails the backup or copy job, and you should either modify your lifecycle settings or use a different vault. The longest maximum retention period you can specify is 36500 days (approximately 100 years). Recovery points already saved in the vault prior to Vault Lock are not affected.

`--changeable-for-days` (long)

The Backup Vault Lock configuration that specifies the number of days before the lock date. For example, setting `ChangeableForDays` to 30 on Jan. 1, 2022 at 8pm UTC will set the lock date to Jan. 31, 2022 at 8pm UTC.

Backup enforces a 72-hour cooling-off period before Vault Lock takes effect and becomes immutable. Therefore, you must set `ChangeableForDays` to 3 or greater.

Before the lock date, you can delete Vault Lock from the vault using `DeleteBackupVaultLockConfiguration` or change the Vault Lock configuration using `PutBackupVaultLockConfiguration` . On and after the lock date, the Vault Lock becomes immutable and cannot be changed or deleted.

If this parameter is not specified, you can delete Vault Lock from the vault using `DeleteBackupVaultLockConfiguration` or change the Vault Lock configuration using `PutBackupVaultLockConfiguration` at any time.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

None
