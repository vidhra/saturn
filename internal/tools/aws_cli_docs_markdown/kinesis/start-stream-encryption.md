# start-stream-encryption

## Description

Enables or updates server-side encryption using an Amazon Web Services KMS key for a specified stream.

### Note

When invoking this API, you must use either the `StreamARN` or the `StreamName` parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the `StreamARN` input parameter when you invoke this API.

Starting encryption is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request, Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to `UPDATING` . After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the status of the stream back to `ACTIVE` . Updating or applying encryption normally takes a few seconds to complete, but it can take minutes. You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is `UPDATING` . Once the status of the stream is `ACTIVE` , encryption begins for records written to the stream.

API Limits: You can successfully apply a new Amazon Web Services KMS key for server-side encryption 25 times in a rolling 24-hour period.

Note: It can take up to 5 seconds after the stream is in an `ACTIVE` status before all records written to the stream are encrypted. After you enable encryption, you can verify that encryption is applied by inspecting the API response from `PutRecord` or `PutRecords` .

## Options

`--stream-name` (string)

The name of the stream for which to start encrypting records.

`--encryption-type` (string)

The encryption type to use. The only valid value is `KMS` .

Possible values:

- `NONE`
- `KMS`

`--key-id` (string)

The GUID for the customer-managed Amazon Web Services KMS key to use for encryption. This value can be a globally unique identifier, a fully specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to either an alias or a key, or an alias name prefixed by âalias/â.You can also use a master key owned by Kinesis Data Streams by specifying the alias `aws/kinesis` .

- Key ARN example: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`
- Alias ARN example: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName`
- Globally unique key ID example: `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`
- Alias name example: `alias/MyAliasName`
- Master key owned by Kinesis Data Streams: `alias/aws/kinesis`

`--stream-arn` (string)

The ARN of the stream.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To enable data stream encryption**

The following `start-stream-encryption` example enables server-side encryption for the specified stream, using the specified AWS KMS key.

```
aws kinesis start-stream-encryption \
    --encryption-type KMS \
    --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:012345678912:key/a3c4a7cd-728b-45dd-b334-4d3eb496e452 \
    --stream-name samplestream
```

This command produces no output.
