# list-flow-operations

## Description

Returns a list of all flow operations ran in a specific firewall. You can optionally narrow the request scope by specifying the operation type or Availability Zone associated with a firewallâs flow operations.

Flow operations let you manage the flows tracked in the flow table, also known as the firewall table.

A flow is network traffic that is monitored by a firewall, either by stateful or stateless rules. For traffic to be considered part of a flow, it must share Destination, DestinationPort, Direction, Protocol, Source, and SourcePort.

`list-flow-operations` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the `--no-paginate` argument.
When using `--output text` and the `--query` argument on a paginated response, the `--query` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: `FlowOperations`

```

## Options

`--firewall-arn` (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

`--availability-zone` (string)

The ID of the Availability Zone where the firewall is located. For example, `us-east-2a` .

Defines the scope a flow operation. You can use up to 20 filters to configure a single flow operation.

`--flow-operation-type` (string)

An optional string that defines whether any or all operation types are returned.

Possible values:

- `FLOW_FLUSH`
- `FLOW_CAPTURE`

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--starting-token` (string)

A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the `NextToken` from a previously truncated response.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--page-size` (integer)

The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the commandâs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--max-items` (integer)

The total number of items to return in the commandâs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a `NextToken` is provided in the commandâs output. To resume pagination, provide the `NextToken` value in the `starting-token` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the `NextToken` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

FlowOperations -> (list)

Flow operations let you manage the flows tracked in the flow table, also known as the firewall table.

A flow is network traffic that is monitored by a firewall, either by stateful or stateless rules. For traffic to be considered part of a flow, it must share Destination, DestinationPort, Direction, Protocol, Source, and SourcePort.

(structure)

An array of objects with metadata about the requested `FlowOperation` .

FlowOperationId -> (string)

A unique identifier for the flow operation. This ID is returned in the responses to start and list commands. You provide to describe commands.

FlowOperationType -> (string)

Defines the type of `FlowOperation` .

FlowRequestTimestamp -> (timestamp)

A timestamp indicating when the Suricata engine identified flows impacted by an operation.

FlowOperationStatus -> (string)

Returns the status of the flow operation. This string is returned in the responses to start, list, and describe commands.

If the status is `COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS` , results may be returned with any number of `Flows` missing from the response. If the status is `FAILED` , `Flows` returned will be empty.

NextToken -> (string)

When you request a list of objects with a `MaxResults` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the maximum you requested, Network Firewall returns a `NextToken` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token returned from the prior request in your next request.
