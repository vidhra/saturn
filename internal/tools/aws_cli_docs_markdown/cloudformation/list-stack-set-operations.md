# list-stack-set-operations

## Description

Returns summary information about operations performed on a stack set.

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloudformation-2010-05-15/ListStackSetOperations)

`list-stack-set-operations` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the `--no-paginate` argument.
When using `--output text` and the `--query` argument on a paginated response, the `--query` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: `Summaries`

## Options

`--stack-set-name` (string)

The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to get operation summaries for.

`--call-as` (string)

[Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in the organizationâs management account or as a delegated administrator in a member account.

By default, `SELF` is specified. Use `SELF` for stack sets with self-managed permissions.

- If you are signed in to the management account, specify `SELF` .
- If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify `DELEGATED_ADMIN` . Your Amazon Web Services account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more information, see [Register a delegated administrator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-delegated-admin.html) in the *CloudFormation User Guide* .

Possible values:

- `SELF`
- `DELEGATED_ADMIN`

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--starting-token` (string)

A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the `NextToken` from a previously truncated response.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--page-size` (integer)

The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the commandâs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--max-items` (integer)

The total number of items to return in the commandâs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a `NextToken` is provided in the commandâs output. To resume pagination, provide the `NextToken` value in the `starting-token` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the `NextToken` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To list stack set operations**

The following `list-stack-set-operations` example displays the list of the most recent operations on the specified stack set.

```
aws cloudformation list-stack-set-operations \
    --stack-set-name my-stack-set
```

Output:

```
{
    "Summaries": [
        {
            "OperationId": "35d45ebc-ed88-xmpl-ab59-0197a1fc83a0",
            "Action": "UPDATE",
            "Status": "SUCCEEDED",
            "CreationTimestamp": "2019-10-03T16:28:44.377Z",
            "EndTimestamp": "2019-10-03T16:42:08.607Z"
        },
        {
            "OperationId": "891aa98f-7118-xmpl-00b2-00954d1dd0d6",
            "Action": "UPDATE",

        }
    ]
}
```

## Output

Summaries -> (list)

A list of `StackSetOperationSummary` structures that contain summary information about operations for the specified stack set.

(structure)

The structures that contain summary information about the specified operation.

OperationId -> (string)

The unique ID of the stack set operation.

Action -> (string)

The type of operation: `CREATE` , `UPDATE` , or `DELETE` . Create and delete operations affect only the specified stack instances that are associated with the specified stack set. Update operations affect both the stack set itself and *all* associated stack set instances.

Status -> (string)

The overall status of the operation.

- `FAILED` : The operation exceeded the specified failure tolerance. The failure tolerance value that youâve set for an operation is applied for each Region during stack create and update operations. If the number of failed stacks within a Region exceeds the failure tolerance, the status of the operation in the Region is set to `FAILED` . This in turn sets the status of the operation as a whole to `FAILED` , and CloudFormation cancels the operation in any remaining Regions.
- `QUEUED` : [Service-managed permissions] For automatic deployments that require a sequence of operations, the operation is queued to be performed. For more information, see the [stack set operation status codes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html#stackset-status-codes) in the *CloudFormation User Guide* .
- `RUNNING` : The operation is currently being performed.
- `STOPPED` : The user has canceled the operation.
- `STOPPING` : The operation is in the process of stopping, at user request.
- `SUCCEEDED` : The operation completed creating or updating all the specified stacks without exceeding the failure tolerance for the operation.

CreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)

The time at which the operation was initiated. Note that the creation times for the stack set operation might differ from the creation time of the individual stacks themselves. This is because CloudFormation needs to perform preparatory work for the operation, such as dispatching the work to the requested Regions, before actually creating the first stacks.

EndTimestamp -> (timestamp)

The time at which the stack set operation ended, across all accounts and Regions specified. Note that this doesnât necessarily mean that the stack set operation was successful, or even attempted, in each account or Region.

StatusReason -> (string)

The status of the operation in details.

StatusDetails -> (structure)

Detailed information about the stack set operation.

FailedStackInstancesCount -> (integer)

The number of stack instances for which the StackSet operation failed.

OperationPreferences -> (structure)

The user-specified preferences for how CloudFormation performs a stack set operation.

For more information about maximum concurrent accounts and failure tolerance, see [Stack set operation options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html#stackset-ops-options) .

RegionConcurrencyType -> (string)

The concurrency type of deploying StackSets operations in Regions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time.

RegionOrder -> (list)

The order of the Regions where you want to perform the stack operation.

(string)

FailureToleranceCount -> (integer)

The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can fail before CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation doesnât attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

Conditional: You must specify either `FailureToleranceCount` or `FailureTolerancePercentage` (but not both).

By default, `0` is specified.

FailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)

The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack operation can fail before CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation doesnât attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, CloudFormation rounds *down* to the next whole number.

Conditional: You must specify either `FailureToleranceCount` or `FailureTolerancePercentage` , but not both.

By default, `0` is specified.

MaxConcurrentCount -> (integer)

The maximum number of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time. This can depend on the value of `FailureToleranceCount` depending on your `ConcurrencyMode` . `MaxConcurrentCount` is at most one more than the `FailureToleranceCount` if youâre using `STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE` .

Note that this setting lets you specify the *maximum* for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

Conditional: You must specify either `MaxConcurrentCount` or `MaxConcurrentPercentage` , but not both.

By default, `1` is specified.

MaxConcurrentPercentage -> (integer)

The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time.

When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number. This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number as one instead.

Note that this setting lets you specify the *maximum* for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

Conditional: You must specify either `MaxConcurrentCount` or `MaxConcurrentPercentage` , but not both.

By default, `1` is specified.

ConcurrencyMode -> (string)

Specifies how the concurrency level behaves during the operation execution.

- `STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE` : This option dynamically lowers the concurrency level to ensure the number of failed accounts never exceeds the value of `FailureToleranceCount` +1. The initial actual concurrency is set to the lower of either the value of the `MaxConcurrentCount` , or the value of `FailureToleranceCount` +1. The actual concurrency is then reduced proportionally by the number of failures. This is the default behavior. If failure tolerance or Maximum concurrent accounts are set to percentages, the behavior is similar.
- `SOFT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE` : This option decouples `FailureToleranceCount` from the actual concurrency. This allows stack set operations to run at the concurrency level set by the `MaxConcurrentCount` value, or `MaxConcurrentPercentage` , regardless of the number of failures.

NextToken -> (string)

If the request doesnât return all results, `NextToken` is set to a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call `ListOperationResults` again and assign that token to the request objectâs `NextToken` parameter. If there are no remaining results, `NextToken` is set to `null` .
