# pipes

## Description

Amazon EventBridge Pipes connects event sources to targets. Pipes reduces the need for specialized knowledge and integration code when developing event driven architectures. This helps ensures consistency across your companyâs applications. With Pipes, the target can be any available EventBridge target. To set up a pipe, you select the event source, add optional event filtering, define optional enrichment, and select the target for the event data.
