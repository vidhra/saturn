# update-asset-model

## Description

Updates an asset model and all of the assets that were created from the model. Each asset created from the model inherits the updated asset modelâs property and hierarchy definitions. For more information, see [Updating assets and models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/update-assets-and-models.html) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide* .

### Warning

If you remove a property from an asset model, IoT SiteWise deletes all previous data for that property. You canât change the type or data type of an existing property.

To replace an existing asset model property with a new one with the same `name` , do the following:

- Submit an `UpdateAssetModel` request with the entire existing property removed.
- Submit a second `UpdateAssetModel` request that includes the new property. The new asset property will have the same `name` as the previous one and IoT SiteWise will generate a new unique `id` .

- If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the metric.
- If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.
- The ISO 8601 format. For example, if you specify `PT18H` for `offset` and `1d` for `interval` , IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following ways:
- If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the metric.
- If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.

For more information, see [Asset hierarchies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/asset-hierarchies.html) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide* .

propertyPath -> (list)

The path of the property.

(structure)

Represents one level between a property and the root of the asset model.

id -> (string)

The ID of the path segment.

name -> (string)

The name of the path segment.

processingConfig -> (structure)

The processing configuration for the given transform property. You can configure transforms to be kept at the edge or forwarded to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. You can also configure transforms to be computed at the edge or in the cloud.

computeLocation -> (string)

The compute location for the given transform property.

forwardingConfig -> (structure)

The forwarding configuration for a given property.

state -> (string)

The forwarding state for the given property.

metric -> (structure)

Specifies an asset metric property. A metric contains a mathematical expression that uses aggregate functions to process all input data points over a time interval and output a single data point, such as to calculate the average hourly temperature.

expression -> (string)

The mathematical expression that defines the metric aggregation function. You can specify up to 10 variables per expression. You can specify up to 10 functions per expression.

For more information, see [Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/quotas.html) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide* .

variables -> (list)

The list of variables used in the expression.

(structure)

Contains expression variable information.

name -> (string)

The friendly name of the variable to be used in the expression.

value -> (structure)

The variable that identifies an asset property from which to use values.

propertyId -> (string)

The ID of the property to use as the variable. You can use the property `name` if itâs from the same asset model. If the property has an external ID, you can specify `externalId:` followed by the external ID. For more information, see [Using external IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-ids) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide* .

hierarchyId -> (string)

The ID of the hierarchy to query for the property ID. You can use the hierarchyâs name instead of the hierarchyâs ID. If the hierarchy has an external ID, you can specify `externalId:` followed by the external ID. For more information, see [Using external IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-ids) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide* .

propertyPath -> (list)

The path of the property.

(structure)

Represents one level between a property and the root of the asset model.

id -> (string)

The ID of the path segment.

name -> (string)

The name of the path segment.

window -> (structure)

The window (time interval) over which IoT SiteWise computes the metricâs aggregation expression. IoT SiteWise computes one data point per `window` .

tumbling -> (structure)

The tumbling time interval window.

interval -> (string)

The time interval for the tumbling window. The interval time must be between 1 minute and 1 week.

IoT SiteWise computes the `1w` interval the end of Sunday at midnight each week (UTC), the `1d` interval at the end of each day at midnight (UTC), the `1h` interval at the end of each hour, and so on.

When IoT SiteWise aggregates data points for metric computations, the start of each interval is exclusive and the end of each interval is inclusive. IoT SiteWise places the computed data point at the end of the interval.

offset -> (string)

The offset for the tumbling window. The `offset` parameter accepts the following:

- The offset time. For example, if you specify `18h` for `offset` and `1d` for `interval` , IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following ways:
- If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the metric.
- If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.
- The ISO 8601 format. For example, if you specify `PT18H` for `offset` and `1d` for `interval` , IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following ways:
- If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the metric.
- If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.
- The 24-hour clock. For example, if you specify `00:03:00` for `offset` , `5m` for `interval` , and you create the metric at 2 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 2:03 PM (UTC). You get the second aggregation result at 2:08 PM (UTC).
- The offset time zone. For example, if you specify `2021-07-23T18:00-08` for `offset` and `1d` for `interval` , IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following ways:
- If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (PST), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (PST) on the day when you create the metric.
- If you create the metric after 6 PM (PST), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (PST) the next day.

processingConfig -> (structure)

path -> (list)

The structured path to the property from the root of the asset model.

(structure)

Represents one level between a property and the root of the asset model.

`--client-token` (string)

A unique case-sensitive identifier that you can provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. Donât reuse this client token if a new idempotent request is required.

`--if-match` (string)

The expected current entity tag (ETag) for the asset modelâs latest or active version (specified using `matchForVersionType` ). The update request is rejected if the tag does not match the latest or active versionâs current entity tag. See [Optimistic locking for asset model writes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/opt-locking-for-model.html) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide* .

`--if-none-match` (string)

Accepts ***** to reject the update request if an active version (specified using `matchForVersionType` as `ACTIVE` ) already exists for the asset model.

`--match-for-version-type` (string)

Specifies the asset model version type (`LATEST` or `ACTIVE` ) used in conjunction with `If-Match` or `If-None-Match` headers to determine the target ETag for the update operation.

Possible values:

- `LATEST`
- `ACTIVE`

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To update an asset model**

The following `update-asset-model` example updates a wind farm asset modelâs description. This example includes the modelâs existing IDs and definitions, because `update-asset-model` overwrites the existing model with the new model.

```
aws iotsitewise update-asset-model \
    --cli-input-json file://update-wind-farm-model.json
```
