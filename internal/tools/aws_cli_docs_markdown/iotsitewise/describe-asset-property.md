# describe-asset-property

## Description

Retrieves information about an asset property.

### Note

When you call this operation for an attribute property, this response includes the default attribute value that you define in the asset model. If you update the default value in the model, this operationâs response includes the new default value.

This operation doesnât return the value of the asset property. To get the value of an asset property, use [GetAssetPropertyValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_GetAssetPropertyValue.html) .

## Options

`--asset-id` (string)

The ID of the asset. This can be either the actual ID in UUID format, or else `externalId:` followed by the external ID, if it has one. For more information, see [Referencing objects with external IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-id-references) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide* .

`--property-id` (string)

The ID of the asset property. This can be either the actual ID in UUID format, or else `externalId:` followed by the external ID, if it has one. For more information, see [Referencing objects with external IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-id-references) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide* .

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

- If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the metric.
- If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.
- The ISO 8601 format. For example, if you specify `PT18H` for `offset` and `1d` for `interval` , IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following ways:
- If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the metric.

- The offset time zone. For example, if you specify `2021-07-23T18:00-08` for `offset` and `1d` for `interval` , IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following ways:
- If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (PST), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (PST) on the day when you create the metric.
- If you create the metric after 6 PM (PST), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (PST) the next day.

- If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the metric.
- If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.
- The ISO 8601 format. For example, if you specify `PT18H` for `offset` and `1d` for `interval` , IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following ways:
- If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the metric.
- If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.
- The 24-hour clock. For example, if you specify `00:03:00` for `offset` , `5m` for `interval` , and you create the metric at 2 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 2:03 PM (UTC). You get the second aggregation result at 2:08 PM (UTC).
- The offset time zone. For example, if you specify `2021-07-23T18:00-08` for `offset` and `1d` for `interval` , IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following ways:
- If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (PST), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (PST) on the day when you create the metric.
- If you create the metric after 6 PM (PST), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (PST) the next day.

processingConfig -> (structure)

The processing configuration for the given metric property. You can configure metrics to be computed at the edge or in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. By default, metrics are forwarded to the cloud.

computeLocation -> (string)

The compute location for the given metric property.

path -> (list)

The structured path to the property from the root of the asset.

(structure)

Represents one level between a property and the root of the asset.

id -> (string)

The ID of the path segment.

name -> (string)

The name of the path segment.

externalId -> (string)

The external ID of the asset property. For more information, see [Using external IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-ids) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide* .

id -> (string)

The ID of the composite model that contains the property.

externalId -> (string)
