# re-encrypt-data

## Description

Re-encrypt ciphertext using DUKPT or Symmetric data encryption keys.

You can either generate an encryption key within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling [CreateKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html) or import your own encryption key by calling [ImportKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_ImportKey.html) . The `KeyArn` for use with this operation must be in a compatible key state with `KeyModesOfUse` set to `Encrypt` .

This operation also supports dynamic keys, allowing you to pass a dynamic encryption key as a TR-31 WrappedKeyBlock. This can be used when key material is frequently rotated, such as during every card transaction, and there is need to avoid importing short-lived keys into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. To re-encrypt using dynamic keys, the `keyARN` is the Key Encryption Key (KEK) of the TR-31 wrapped encryption key material. The incoming wrapped key shall have a key purpose of D0 with a mode of use of B or D. For more information, see [Using Dynamic Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/use-cases-acquirers-dynamickeys.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide* .

For symmetric and DUKPT encryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports `TDES` and `AES` algorithms. To encrypt using DUKPT, a DUKPT key must already exist within your account with `KeyModesOfUse` set to `DeriveKey` or a new DUKPT can be generated by calling [CreateKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html) .

For information about valid keys for this operation, see [Understanding key attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/keys-validattributes.html) and [Key types for specific data operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/crypto-ops-validkeys-ops.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide* .

**Cross-account use** : This operation canât be used across different Amazon Web Services accounts.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To re-encrypt data with a different key**

The following `re-encrypt-data` example decrypts cipher text that was encrypted using an AES symmetric key and re-encrypts it using a Derived Unique Key Per Transaction (DUKPT) key.

```
aws payment-cryptography-data re-encrypt-data \
    --incoming-key-identifier arn:aws:payment-cryptography:us-west-2:111122223333:key/hyvv7ymboitd4vfy \
    --outgoing-key-identifier arn:aws:payment-cryptography:us-west-2:111122223333:key/jl6ythkcvzesbxen \
    --cipher-text 4D2B0BDBA192D5AEFEAA5B3EC28E4A65383C313FFA25140101560F75FE1B99F27192A90980AB9334 \
    --incoming-encryption-attributes "Dukpt={Mode=ECB,KeySerialNumber=0123456789111111}" \
    --outgoing-encryption-attributes '{"Symmetric": {"Mode": "ECB"}}'
```

Output:

```
{
    "CipherText": "F94959DA30EEFF0C035483C6067667CF6796E3C1AD28C2B61F9CFEB772A8DD41C0D6822931E0D3B1",
    "KeyArn": "arn:aws:payment-cryptography:us-west-2:111122223333:key/jl6ythkcvzesbxen",
    "KeyCheckValue": "2E8CD9"
}
```

## Output

KeyArn -> (string)

The keyARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the encryption key that Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses for plaintext encryption.

KeyCheckValue -> (string)

The key check value (KCV) of the encryption key. The KCV is used to check if all parties holding a given key have the same key or to detect that a key has changed.

Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography computes the KCV according to the CMAC specification.

CipherText -> (string)

The encrypted ciphertext.
