## Description

You can use the tax setting API to programmatically set, modify, and delete the tax registration number (TRN), associated business legal name, and address (Collectively referred to as âTRN informationâ). You can also programmatically view TRN information and tax addresses (âTax profilesâ).

You can use this API to automate your TRN information settings instead of manually using the console.
