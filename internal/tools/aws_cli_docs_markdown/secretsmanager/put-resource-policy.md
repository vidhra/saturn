# put-resource-policy

## Description

Attaches a resource-based permission policy to a secret. A resource-based policy is optional. For more information, see [Authentication and access control for Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access.html)

For information about attaching a policy in the console, see [Attach a permissions policy to a secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_resource-based-policies.html) .

Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters because it might be logged. For more information, see [Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieve-ct-entries.html) .

**Required permissions:** `secretsmanager:PutResourcePolicy` . For more information, see [IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_iam-permissions.html#reference_iam-permissions_actions) and [Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access.html) .

## Options

`--secret-id` (string)

The ARN or name of the secret to attach the resource-based policy.

For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than a partial ARN. See [Finding a secret from a partial ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/troubleshoot.html#ARN_secretnamehyphen) .

`--resource-policy` (string)

A JSON-formatted string for an Amazon Web Services resource-based policy. For example policies, see [Permissions policy examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_examples.html) .

`--block-public-policy` | `--no-block-public-policy` (boolean)

Specifies whether to block resource-based policies that allow broad access to the secret, for example those that use a wildcard for the principal. By default, public policies arenât blocked.

### Warning

Resource policy validation and the BlockPublicPolicy parameter help protect your resources by preventing public access from being granted through the resource policies that are directly attached to your secrets. In addition to using these features, carefully inspect the following policies to confirm that they do not grant public access:

- Identity-based policies attached to associated Amazon Web Services principals (for example, IAM roles)
- Resource-based policies attached to associated Amazon Web Services resources (for example, Key Management Service (KMS) keys)

To review permissions to your secrets, see [Determine who has permissions to your secrets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/determine-acccess_examine-iam-policies.html) .

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To add a resource-based policy to a secret**

The following `put-resource-policy` example adds a permissions policy to a secret, checking first that the policy does not provide broad access to the secret. The policy is read from a file. For more information, see [Loading AWS CLI parameters from a file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-file.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide*.

```
aws secretsmanager put-resource-policy \
    --secret-id MyTestSecret \
    --resource-policy file://mypolicy.json \
    --block-public-policy
```

Contents of `mypolicy.json`:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRole"
            },
            "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Output:

```
{
    "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
    "Name": "MyTestSecret"
}
```

For more information, see [Attach a permissions policy to a secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_resource-policies.html) in the *Secrets Manager User Guide*.

## Output

ARN -> (string)

The ARN of the secret.

Name -> (string)

The name of the secret.
