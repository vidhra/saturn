# list-servers

## Description

Lists the file transfer protocol-enabled servers that are associated with your Amazon Web Services account.

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/transfer-2018-11-05/ListServers)

`list-servers` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the `--no-paginate` argument.
When using `--output text` and the `--query` argument on a paginated response, the `--query` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: `Servers`

## Options

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--starting-token` (string)

A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the `NextToken` from a previously truncated response.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--page-size` (integer)

The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the commandâs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--max-items` (integer)

The total number of items to return in the commandâs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a `NextToken` is provided in the commandâs output. To resume pagination, provide the `NextToken` value in the `starting-token` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the `NextToken` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

For usage examples, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Output

NextToken -> (string)

When you can get additional results from the `ListServers` operation, a `NextToken` parameter is returned in the output. In a following command, you can pass in the `NextToken` parameter to continue listing additional servers.

Servers -> (list)

An array of servers that were listed.

(structure)

Returns properties of a file transfer protocol-enabled server that was specified.

Arn -> (string)

Specifies the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a server to be listed.

Domain -> (string)

Specifies the domain of the storage system that is used for file transfers. There are two domains available: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). The default value is S3.

IdentityProviderType -> (string)

The mode of authentication for a server. The default value is `SERVICE_MANAGED` , which allows you to store and access user credentials within the Transfer Family service.

Use `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE` to provide access to Active Directory groups in Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory or Microsoft Active Directory in your on-premises environment or in Amazon Web Services using AD Connector. This option also requires you to provide a Directory ID by using the `IdentityProviderDetails` parameter.

Use the `API_GATEWAY` value to integrate with an identity provider of your choosing. The `API_GATEWAY` setting requires you to provide an Amazon API Gateway endpoint URL to call for authentication by using the `IdentityProviderDetails` parameter.

Use the `AWS_LAMBDA` value to directly use an Lambda function as your identity provider. If you choose this value, you must specify the ARN for the Lambda function in the `Function` parameter for the `IdentityProviderDetails` data type.

EndpointType -> (string)

Specifies the type of VPC endpoint that your server is connected to. If your server is connected to a VPC endpoint, your server isnât accessible over the public internet.

LoggingRole -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows a server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging for Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS events. When set, you can view user activity in your CloudWatch logs.

ServerId -> (string)

Specifies the unique system assigned identifier for the servers that were listed.

State -> (string)

The condition of the server that was described. A value of `ONLINE` indicates that the server can accept jobs and transfer files. A `State` value of `OFFLINE` means that the server cannot perform file transfer operations.

The states of `STARTING` and `STOPPING` indicate that the server is in an intermediate state, either not fully able to respond, or not fully offline. The values of `START_FAILED` or `STOP_FAILED` can indicate an error condition.

UserCount -> (integer)

Specifies the number of users that are assigned to a server you specified with the `ServerId` .
