[--cli-binary-format <value>]
[--no-cli-pager]
[--cli-auto-prompt]
[--no-cli-auto-prompt]
```

## Options

`--job-id` (string)

The identifier that Amazon Comprehend generated for the job. The `StartTargetedSentimentDetectionJob` operation returns this identifier in its response.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

An object that contains the properties associated with a targeted sentiment detection job.

JobId -> (string)

The identifier assigned to the targeted sentiment detection job.

JobArn -> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the targeted sentiment detection job. It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the job. It includes the Amazon Web Services account, Amazon Web Services Region, and the job ID. The format of the ARN is as follows:

`arn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<account-id>:targeted-sentiment-detection-job/<job-id>`

The following is an example job ARN:

`arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:targeted-sentiment-detection-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab`

JobName -> (string)

The name that you assigned to the targeted sentiment detection job.

JobStatus -> (string)

The current status of the targeted sentiment detection job. If the status is `FAILED` , the `Messages` field shows the reason for the failure.

Message -> (string)

A description of the status of a job.

SubmitTime -> (timestamp)

The time that the targeted sentiment detection job was submitted for processing.

EndTime -> (timestamp)

The time that the targeted sentiment detection job ended.

InputDataConfig -> (structure)

The input properties for an inference job. The document reader config field applies only to non-text inputs for custom analysis.

S3Uri -> (string)

The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in same Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for a collection of data files.

For example, if you use the URI `S3://bucketName/prefix` , if the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

InputFormat -> (string)

Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

- `ONE_DOC_PER_FILE` - Each file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing large documents, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.
- `ONE_DOC_PER_LINE` - Each line in a file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing many short documents, such as text messages.

DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)

Provides configuration parameters to override the default actions for extracting text from PDF documents and image files.

DocumentReadAction -> (string)

This field defines the Amazon Textract API operation that Amazon Comprehend uses to extract text from PDF files and image files. Enter one of the following values:

- `TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT` - The Amazon Comprehend service uses the `DetectDocumentText` API operation.
- `TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT` - The Amazon Comprehend service uses the `AnalyzeDocument` API operation.

DocumentReadMode -> (string)

Determines the text extraction actions for PDF files. Enter one of the following values:

- `SERVICE_DEFAULT` - use the Amazon Comprehend service defaults for PDF files.
- `FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION` - Amazon Comprehend uses the Textract API specified by DocumentReadAction for all PDF files, including digital PDF files.

FeatureTypes -> (list)

Specifies the type of Amazon Textract features to apply. If you chose `TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT` as the read action, you must specify one or both of the following values:

- `TABLES` - Returns additional information about any tables that are detected in the input document.
- `FORMS` - Returns additional information about any forms that are detected in the input document.

(string)

TABLES or FORMS

OutputDataConfig -> (structure)

Provides configuration parameters for the output of inference jobs.

S3Uri -> (string)

When you use the `OutputDataConfig` object with asynchronous operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want to write the output data. The URI must be in the same Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The location is used as the prefix for the actual location of the output file.

When the topic detection job is finished, the service creates an output file in a directory specific to the job. The `S3Uri` field contains the location of the output file, called `output.tar.gz` . It is a compressed archive that contains the ouput of the operation.

For a PII entity detection job, the output file is plain text, not a compressed archive. The output file name is the same as the input file, with `.out` appended at the end.

KmsKeyId -> (string)

ID for the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from an analysis job. Specify the Key Id of a symmetric key, because you cannot use an asymmetric key for uploading data to S3.

The KmsKeyId can be one of the following formats:

- KMS Key ID: `"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"`
- Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key: `"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"`
- KMS Key Alias: `"alias/ExampleAlias"`
- ARN of a KMS Key Alias: `"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"`
