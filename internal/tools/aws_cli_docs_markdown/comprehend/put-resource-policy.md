# put-resource-policy

## Description

Attaches a resource-based policy to a custom model. You can use this policy to authorize an entity in another Amazon Web Services account to import the custom model, which replicates it in Amazon Comprehend in their account.

```

## Options

`--resource-arn` (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom model to attach the policy to.

`--resource-policy` (string)

The JSON resource-based policy to attach to your custom model. Provide your JSON as a UTF-8 encoded string without line breaks. To provide valid JSON for your policy, enclose the attribute names and values in double quotes. If the JSON body is also enclosed in double quotes, then you must escape the double quotes that are inside the policy:

`"{\"attribute\": \"value\", \"attribute\": [\"value\"]}"`

To avoid escaping quotes, you can use single quotes to enclose the policy and double quotes to enclose the JSON names and values:

`'{"attribute": "value", "attribute": ["value"]}'`

`--policy-revision-id` (string)

The revision ID that Amazon Comprehend assigned to the policy that you are updating. If you are creating a new policy that has no prior version, donât use this parameter. Amazon Comprehend creates the revision ID for you.

`--cli-input-json` | `--cli-input-yaml` (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by `--generate-cli-skeleton`. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with `--cli-input-yaml`.

`--generate-cli-skeleton` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value `input`, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for `--cli-input-json`. Similarly, if provided `yaml-input` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with `--cli-input-yaml`. If provided with the value `output`, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

## Global Options

`--debug` (boolean)

Turn on debug logging.

`--endpoint-url` (string)

Override commandâs default URL with the given URL.

`--no-verify-ssl` (boolean)

By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services. For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

`--no-paginate` (boolean)

Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

`--output` (string)

The formatting style for command output.

- json
- text
- table
- yaml
- yaml-stream

`--query` (string)

A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

`--profile` (string)

Use a specific profile from your credential file.

`--region` (string)

The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

`--version` (string)

Display the version of this tool.

`--color` (string)

Turn on/off color output.

- on
- off
- auto

`--no-sign-request` (boolean)

Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided.

`--ca-bundle` (string)

The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Overrides config/env settings.

`--cli-read-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-connect-timeout` (int)

The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.

`--cli-binary-format` (string)

The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs to be provided as a base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary blob `fileb://` will always be treated as binary and use the file contents directly regardless of the `cli-binary-format` setting. When using `file://` the file contents will need to properly formatted for the configured `cli-binary-format`.

- base64
- raw-in-base64-out

`--no-cli-pager` (boolean)

Disable cli pager for output.

`--cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

`--no-cli-auto-prompt` (boolean)

Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

## Examples

### Note

To use the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. See the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* for more information.

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâs quoting rules. See [Using quotation marks with strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

**To attach a resource-based policy**

The following `put-resource-policy` example attaches a resource-based policy to a model so that can be imported by another AWS account.
The policy is attached to the model in account `111122223333` and allows account `444455556666` import the model.

```
aws comprehend put-resource-policy \
    --resource-arn arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:document-classifier/example-classifier/version/1 \
    --resource-policy '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Effect":"Allow","Action":"comprehend:ImportModel","Resource":"*","Principal":{"AWS":["arn:aws:iam::444455556666:root"]}}]}'
```

Ouput:

```
{
    "PolicyRevisionId": "aaa111d069d07afaa2aa3106aEXAMPLE"
}
```

For more information, see [Copying custom models between AWS accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/custom-copy.html) in the *Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide*.

## Output

PolicyRevisionId -> (string)

The revision ID of the policy. Each time you modify a policy, Amazon Comprehend assigns a new revision ID, and it deletes the prior version of the policy.
