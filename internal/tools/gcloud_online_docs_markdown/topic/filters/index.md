**NAME**

: **gcloud topic filters - resource filters supplementary help**

**DESCRIPTION**

: Most `[gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference)` commands return a
list of resources on success. By default they are pretty-printed on the standard
output. The
`--format=``NAME`[`ATTRIBUTES`]`(``PROJECTION``)`
and `--filter=``EXPRESSION` flags along with
projections can be used to format and change the default output to a more
meaningful result.
Use the `--format` flag to change the default output format of a
command. For details run $ [gcloud
topic formats](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/formats).
Use the `--filter` flag to select resources to be listed. Resource
filters are described in detail below.
Use resource-keys to reach resource items through a unique path of names from
the root. For details run $ [gcloud topic resource-keys](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/resource-keys).
Use projections to list a subset of resource keys in a resource. For details run
$ [gcloud topic
projections](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/projections).
Note: To refer to a list of fields you can sort, filter, and format by for each
resource, you can run a list command with the format set to `text` or
`json`. For example, $ [gcloud compute instances
list](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/list) --limit=1 --format=text.
To work through an interactive tutorial about using the filter and format flags
instead, see: [https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-shell-tutorials&page=editor&tutorial=cloudsdk/tutorial.md](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-shell-tutorials&page=editor&tutorial=cloudsdk/tutorial.md)
Note: Depending on the specific server API, filtering may be done entirely by
the client, entirely by the server, or by a combination of both.

**Filter Expressions**

: A filter expression is a Boolean function that selects the resources to print
from a list of resources. Expressions are composed of terms connected by logic
operators.

**`LogicOperator`**:
Logic operators must be in uppercase: `AND`, `OR`,
`NOT`. Additionally, expressions containing both `AND` and
`OR` must be parenthesized to disambiguate precedence.

**`NOT` `term-1`**:
True if `term-1` is False, otherwise False.

**`term-1` `AND` `term-2`**:
True if both `term-1` and `term-2`
are true.

**`term-1` `OR` `term-2`**:
True if at least one of `term-1` or
`term-2` is true.

**`term-1` `term-2`**:
Term conjunction (implicit `AND`) is True if both
`term-1` and `term-2` are true.
Conjunction has lower precedence than `OR`.

**`Terms`**:
A term is a `key` `operator`
`value` tuple, where `key` is a
dotted name that evaluates to the value of a resource attribute, and
`value` may be:

**`number`**:
integer or floating point numeric constant

**`unquoted literal`**:
character sequence terminated by space, ( or )

**`quoted literal`**:
`"…"` or `'…'`
Most filter expressions need to be quoted in shell commands. If you use
`'…'` shell quotes then use
`"…"` filter string literal quotes and vice versa.

Quoted literals will be interpreted as string values, even when the value could
also be a valid number. For example, 'key:1e9' will be interpreted as a key
named 'key' with the string value '1e9', rather than with the float value of one
billion expressed in scientific notation.

**`Operator Terms`**:
**`key` `:` `simple-pattern`**:
`:` operator evaluation is changing for consistency across Google
APIs. The current default is deprecated and will be dropped shortly. A warning
will be displayed when a --filter expression would return different matches
using both the deprecated and new implementations.
The current deprecated default is True if `key` contains
`simple-pattern`. The match is case insensitive. It allows
one `*` that matches any sequence of 0 or more characters. If
`*` is specified then the match is anchored, meaning all characters
from the beginning and end of the value must match.
The new implementation is True if `simple-pattern` matches
any `word` in `key`. Words are
locale specific but typically consist of alpha-numeric characters. Non-word
characters that do not appear in `simple-pattern` are
ignored. The matching is anchored and case insensitive. An optional trailing
`*` does a word prefix match.
Use `key``:*` to test if
`key` is defined and
`-``key``:*` to test if
`key` is undefined.

**`key` `:(` `simple-pattern` … `)`**:
True if `key` matches any
`simple-pattern` in the (space, tab, newline, comma)
separated list.

**`key` `=` `value`**:
True if `key` is equal to `value`,
or [deprecated] equivalent to `:` with the exception that the
trailing `*` prefix match is not supported.
For historical reasons, this operation currently behaves differently for
different Google APIs. For many APIs, this is True if key is equal to value. For
a few APIs, this is currently equivalent to `:`, with the exception
that the trailing `*` prefix match is not supported. However, this
behaviour is being phased out, and use of `=` for those APIs is
deprecated; for those APIs, if you want matching, you should use `:`
instead of `=`, and if you want to test for equality, you can use
`key` <= `value` AND
`key` >= `value`.

**`key` `=(` `value` … `)`**:
True if `key` is equal to any
`value` in the (space, tab, newline, `,`)
separated list.

**`key` `!=` `value`**:
True if `key` is not `value`.
Equivalent to -`key`=`value` and NOT
`key`=`value`.

**`key` `<` `value`**:
True if `key` is less than `value`.
If both `key` and `value` are
numeric then numeric comparison is used, otherwise lexicographic string
comparison is used.

**`key` `<=` `value`**:
True if `key` is less than or equal to
`value`. If both `key` and
`value` are numeric then numeric comparison is used,
otherwise lexicographic string comparison is used.

**`key` `>=` `value`**:
True if `key` is greater than or equal to
`value`. If both `key` and
`value` are numeric then numeric comparison is used,
otherwise lexicographic string comparison is used.

**`key` `>` `value`**:
True if `key` is greater than
`value`. If both `key` and
`value` are numeric then numeric comparison is used,
otherwise lexicographic string comparison is used.

**`key` `~` `value`**:
True if `key` contains a match for the RE (regular
expression) pattern `value`. Depending on your shell, you
might have to escape or quote `~` to ensure it isn't
consumed as HOME.

**`key` `!~` `value`**:
True if `key` does not contain a match for the RE (regular
expression) pattern `value`. Depending on your shell, you
might have to escape or quote `~` to ensure it isn't
consumed as HOME.

Regular expressions are evaluated using Python's standard library: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re-syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re-syntax).

**Determine which fields are available for filtering**

: In order to build filters, it is often helpful to review some representative
fields returned from commands. One simple way to do this is to add
`--format=yaml --limit=1` to a command. With these flags, a single
record is returned and its full contents are displayed as a YAML document. For
example, a list of project fields could be generated by running:

```
gcloud projects list --format=yaml --limit=1
```

This might display the following data:

```
createTime: '2021-02-10T19:19:49.242Z'
lifecycleState: ACTIVE
name: MyProject
parent:
  id: '123'
  type: folder
projectId: my-project
projectNumber: '456'
```

Using this data, one way of filtering projects is by their parent's ID by
specifying ``parent.id`` as the
`key`.

**Filter on a custom or nested list in response**

: By default the filter expression operates on root level resources. In order to
filter on a nested list(not at the root level of the json) , one can use the
`--flatten` flag to provide a the `resource-key` to list.
For example, To list members under `my-project` that have an editor
role, one can run:

```
gcloud projects get-iam-policy cloudsdktest --flatten=bindings --filter=bindings.role:roles/editor --format='value(bindings.members)'
```

**EXAMPLES**

: List all Google Compute Engine instance resources:

```
gcloud compute instances list
```

List Compute Engine instance resources that have machineType
`f1-micro`:

```
gcloud compute instances list --filter="machineType:f1-micro"
```

List Compute Engine instance resources using a regular expression for zone
`us` and not MachineType `f1-micro`:

```
gcloud compute instances list --filter="zone ~ us AND -machineType:f1-micro"
```

List Compute Engine instance resources with tag `my-tag`:

```
gcloud compute instances list --filter="tags.items=my-tag"
```

List Compute Engine instance resources with tag `my-tag` or
`my-other-tag`:

```
gcloud compute instances list --filter="tags.items=(my-tag,my-other-tag)"
```

List Compute Engine instance resources with tag `my-tag` and
`my-other-tag`:

```
gcloud compute instances list --filter="tags.items=my-tag AND tags.items=my-other-tag"
```

List Compute Engine instance resources which either have tag `my-tag`
but not `my-other-tag` or have tag `alternative-tag`:

```
gcloud compute instances list --filter="(tags.items=my-tag AND -tags.items=my-other-tag) OR tags.items=alternative-tag"
```

List Compute Engine instance resources which contain the key
`fingerprint` in the `metadata` object:

```
gcloud compute instances list --limit=1 --filter="metadata.list(show="keys"):fingerprint"
```

List Compute Engine instance resources with label `my-label` with any
value:

```
gcloud compute instances list --filter="labels.my-label:*"
```

List Container Registry images that have a tag with the value '30e5504145':

```
gcloud container images list-tags --filter="'tags:30e5504145'"
```

The last example encloses the filter expression in single quotes because the
value '30e5504145' could be interpreted as a number in scientific notation.
List in JSON format those projects where the labels match specific values (e.g.
label.env is 'test' and label.version is alpha):

```
gcloud projects list --format="json" --filter="labels.env=test AND labels.version=alpha"
```

List projects that were created on and after a specific date:

```
gcloud projects list --format="table(projectNumber,projectId,createTime)" --filter="createTime>=2018-01-15"
```

List projects that were created on and after a specific date and time and sort
from oldest to newest (with dates and times listed according to the local
timezone):

```
gcloud projects list --format="table(projectNumber,projectId,createTime.date(tz=LOCAL))" --filter="createTime>=2018-01-15T12:00:00" --sort-by=createTime
```

List projects that were created within the last two weeks, using ISO8601
durations:

```
gcloud projects list --format="table(projectNumber,projectId,createTime)" --filter="createTime>-P2W"
```

For more about ISO8601 durations, see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
The table below shows examples of pattern matching if used with the
