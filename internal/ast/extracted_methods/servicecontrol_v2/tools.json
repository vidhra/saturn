This feature is only available for approved\nservices.\n\nThis method provides admission control for services that are\nintegrated with `Service\nInfrastructure <https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure>`__.\nIt checks whether an operation should be allowed based on the\nservice configuration and relevant policies. It must be called\nbefore the operation is executed. For more information, see\n`Admission\nControl <https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/admission-control>`__.\n\nNOTE: The admission control has an expected policy propagation\ndelay of 60s.
