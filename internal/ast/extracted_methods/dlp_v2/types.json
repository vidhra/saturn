This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text.  Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is being transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used to denote the location of the token and are necessary for re-identification in free form text.  In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this info type must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either  -  reverse a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier -  be unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error  Therefore, choose your custom info type name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: \u29ddMY_TOKEN_TYPE."
