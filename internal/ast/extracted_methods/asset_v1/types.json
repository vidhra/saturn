Examples:  -  ``policy:amy@gmail.com`` to find IAM policy bindings that specify user \"amy@gmail.com\". -  ``policy:roles/compute.admin`` to find IAM policy bindings that specify the Compute Admin role. -  ``policy:comp*`` to find IAM policy bindings that contain \"comp\" as a prefix of any word in the binding. -  ``policy.role.permissions:storage.buckets.update`` to find IAM policy bindings that specify a role containing \"storage.buckets.update\" permission. Note that if callers don't have ``iam.roles.get`` access to a role's included permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will be dropped from the search results. -  ``policy.role.permissions:upd*`` to find IAM policy bindings that specify a role containing \"upd\" as a prefix of any word in the role permission. Note that if callers don't have ``iam.roles.get`` access to a role's included permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will be dropped from the search results. -  ``resource:organizations/123456`` to find IAM policy bindings that are set on \"organizations/123456\". -  ``resource=//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/myproject`` to find IAM policy bindings that are set on the project named \"myproject\". -  ``Important`` to find IAM policy bindings that contain \"Important\" as a word in any of the searchable fields (except for the included permissions). -  ``resource:(instance1 OR instance2) policy:amy`` to find IAM policy bindings that are set on resources \"instance1\" or \"instance2\" and also specify user \"amy\". -  ``roles:roles/compute.admin`` to find IAM policy bindings that specify the Compute Admin role. -  ``memberTypes:user`` to find IAM policy bindings that contain the principal type \"user\"."
