Similarly, if x is above/below a warning threshold that triggers above/below, then the scorecard is in a warning state - unless x also puts it in a danger state. (Danger trumps warning.)  As an example, consider a scorecard with the following four thresholds:  ::  { value: 90, category: 'DANGER', trigger: 'ABOVE', }, { value: 70, category: 'WARNING', trigger: 'ABOVE', }, { value: 10, category: 'DANGER', trigger: 'BELOW', }, { value: 20, category: 'WARNING', trigger: 'BELOW', }  Then: values less than or equal to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER state, values greater than 10 but less than or equal to 20 a WARNING state, values strictly between 20 and 70 an OK state, values greater than or equal to 70 but less than 90 a WARNING state, and values greater than or equal to 90 a DANGER state.",

Not all reducer operations can be applied to all time series. The valid choices depend on the ``metric_kind`` and the ``value_type`` of the original time series. Reduction can yield a time series with a different ``metric_kind`` or ``value_type`` than the input time series.  Time series data must first be aligned (see ``per_series_aligner``) in order to perform cross-time series reduction. If ``cross_series_reducer`` is specified, then ``per_series_aligner`` must be specified, and must not be ``ALIGN_NONE``. An ``alignment_period`` must also be specified; otherwise, an error is returned.",

Not all reducer operations can be applied to all time series. The valid choices depend on the ``metric_kind`` and the ``value_type`` of the original time series. Reduction can yield a time series with a different ``metric_kind`` or ``value_type`` than the input time series.  Time series data must first be aligned (see ``per_series_aligner``) in order to perform cross-time series reduction. If ``cross_series_reducer`` is specified, then ``per_series_aligner`` must be specified, and must not be ``ALIGN_NONE``. An ``alignment_period`` must also be specified; otherwise, an error is returned.",

For an actual value x, the scorecard is in a danger state if x is less than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers below, or greater than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers above. Similarly, if x is above/below a warning threshold that triggers above/below, then the scorecard is in a warning state - unless x also puts it in a danger state. (Danger trumps warning.)  As an example, consider a scorecard with the following four thresholds:  ::  { value: 90, category: 'DANGER', trigger: 'ABOVE', }, { value: 70, category: 'WARNING', trigger: 'ABOVE', }, { value: 10, category: 'DANGER', trigger: 'BELOW', }, { value: 20, category: 'WARNING', trigger: 'BELOW', }  Then: values less than or equal to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER state, values greater than 10 but less than or equal to 20 a WARNING state, values strictly between 20 and 70 an OK state, values greater than or equal to 70 but less than 90 a WARNING state, and values greater than or equal to 90 a DANGER state.",
