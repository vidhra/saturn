They may also be resized up or down, to accommodate\nthe workload.\n\nAttributes:\n    name (str):\n        The name of the node pool.\n    config (google.cloud.container_v1.types.NodeConfig):\n        The node configuration of the pool.\n    initial_node_count (int):\n        The initial node count for the pool.
