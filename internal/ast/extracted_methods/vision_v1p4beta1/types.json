If you do not specify the ``bounding-poly`` column, then the system will try to detect regions of interest automatically.  At most one ``bounding-poly`` column is allowed per line. If the image contains multiple regions of interest, add a line to the CSV file that includes the same product information, and the ``bounding-poly`` values for each region of interest.  The ``bounding-poly`` column must contain an even number of comma-separated numbers, in the format \"p1_x,p1_y,p2_x,p2_y,...,pn_x,pn_y\". Use non-negative integers for absolute bounding polygons, and float values in [0, 1] for normalized bounding polygons.
