Valid options include \"CUSTOM\", \"APP_ENGINE\", \"MESH_ISTIO\", and the other options listed at https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/services#Service  To filter on an attribute of a service-identifier type, apply the filter name by using the snake case of the service-identifier type and the attribute of that service-identifier type, and join the two with a period. For example, to filter by the ``meshUid`` field of the ``MeshIstio`` service-identifier type, you must filter on ``mesh_istio.mesh_uid = \"123\"`` to match all services with mesh UID \"123\". Service-identifier types and their attributes are described at https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/services#Service",
