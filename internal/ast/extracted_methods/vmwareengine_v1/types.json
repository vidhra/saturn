For example, if you are filtering a list of private clouds, you can exclude the ones named ``example-pc`` by specifying ``name != \"example-pc\"``.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify ``networkConfig.managementCidr = \"192.168.0.0/24\"`` to include private clouds only if they have a matching address in their network configuration.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example:  ::  (name = \"example-pc\") (createTime > \"2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z\")  By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
