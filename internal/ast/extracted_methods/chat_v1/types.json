To filter by multiple event types, use the ``OR`` operator. Omit batch event types in your filter. The request automatically returns any related batch events. For example, if you filter by new reactions (``google.workspace.chat.reaction.v1.created``), the server also returns batch new reactions events (``google.workspace.chat.reaction.v1.batchCreated``). For a list of supported event types, see the ```SpaceEvents`` reference documentation <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.spaceEvents#SpaceEvent.FIELDS.event_type>`__.  Optionally, you can also filter by start time (``start_time``) and end time (``end_time``):  -  ``start_time``: Exclusive timestamp from which to start listing space events. You can list events that occurred up to 28 days ago. If unspecified, lists space events from the past 28 days. -  ``end_time``: Inclusive timestamp until which space events are listed. If unspecified, lists events up to the time of the request.  To specify a start or end time, use the equals ``=`` operator and format in `RFC-3339 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339>`__. To filter by both ``start_time`` and ``end_time``, use the ``AND`` operator.  For example, the following queries are valid:  ::  start_time=\"2023-08-23T19:20:33+00:00\" AND end_time=\"2023-08-23T19:21:54+00:00\"  ::  start_time=\"2023-08-23T19:20:33+00:00\" AND (event_types:\"google.workspace.chat.space.v1.updated\" OR event_types:\"google.workspace.chat.message.v1.created\")  The following queries are invalid:  ::  start_time=\"2023-08-23T19:20:33+00:00\" OR end_time=\"2023-08-23T19:21:54+00:00\"  ::  event_types:\"google.workspace.chat.space.v1.updated\" AND event_types:\"google.workspace.chat.message.v1.created\"  Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an ``INVALID_ARGUMENT`` error."
