This interpretation applies to the ``injected_first_solution_routes``, ``injected_solution_constraint``, and ``refresh_details_routes`` fields.

Removing route visits or entire routes from an injected solution may have an effect on the implied constraints, which may lead to change in solution, validation errors, or infeasibility.
