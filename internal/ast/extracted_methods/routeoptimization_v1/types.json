This interpretation applies to the ``injected_first_solution_routes``, ``injected_solution_constraint``, and ``refresh_details_routes`` fields.

If a ``vehicle_label`` in the injected solution does not correspond to a request vehicle, the corresponding route is removed from the solution along with its visits.

Removing route visits or entire routes from an injected solution may have an effect on the implied constraints, which may lead to change in solution, validation errors, or infeasibility.  NOTE: The caller must ensure that each [Vehicle.label][google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.Vehicle.label] (resp.
