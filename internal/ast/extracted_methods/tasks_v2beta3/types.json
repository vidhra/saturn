If the task's queue was created using Cloud Tasks, then another task with the same name can't be created for ~1 hour after the original task was deleted or executed. If the task's queue was created using queue.yaml or queue.xml, then another task with the same name can't be created for ~9 days after the original task was deleted or executed.  Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task names, these [CreateTask][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.CloudTasks.CreateTask] calls have significantly increased latency. Using hashed strings for the task id or for the prefix of the task id is recommended. Choosing task ids that are sequential or have sequential prefixes, for example using a timestamp, causes an increase in latency and error rates in all task commands.

Cloud Tasks will retry the task according to the [RetryConfig][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.RetryConfig].  Note that when the request is cancelled, Cloud Tasks will stop listening for the response, but whether the worker stops processing depends on the worker. For example, if the worker is stuck, it may not react to cancelled requests.  The default and maximum values depend on the type of request:  -  For [HTTP tasks][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.HttpRequest], the default is 10 minutes. The deadline must be in the interval [15 seconds, 30 minutes].  -  For [App Engine tasks][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.AppEngineHttpRequest], 0 indicates that the request has the default deadline. The default deadline depends on the `scaling type <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/how-instances-are-managed#instance_scaling>`__ of the service: 10 minutes for standard apps with automatic scaling, 24 hours for standard apps with manual and basic scaling, and 60 minutes for flex apps. If the request deadline is set, it must be in the interval [15 seconds, 24 hours 15 seconds].
