After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results.

An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same [company][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.company], [language_code][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.language_code] and [requisition_id][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.requisition_id].  The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out.  Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided.  If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the [posting_publish_time][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.posting_publish_time] must be set before [posting_expire_time][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.posting_expire_time]. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as [Application][], to refer a job that didn't exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one.  If this value isn't provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC.  If this value isn't provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by [UpdateJobRequest.update_mask][google.cloud.talent.v4.UpdateJobRequest.update_mask]. If the field masks include [job_end_time][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.job_end_time], or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated."
