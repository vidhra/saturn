This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time.  The state_change value is derived based on the presence and state of the finding at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the result. For example, the results aren't affected if the finding is made inactive and then active again.  Possible \"state_change\" values when compare_duration is specified:  -  \"CHANGED\": indicates that the finding was present and matched the given filter at the start of compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time. -  \"UNCHANGED\": indicates that the finding was present and matched the given filter at the start of compare_duration and did not change state at read_time. -  \"ADDED\": indicates that the finding did not match the given filter or was not present at the start of compare_duration, but was present at read_time. -  \"REMOVED\": indicates that the finding was present and matched the filter at the start of compare_duration, but did not match the filter at read_time.
