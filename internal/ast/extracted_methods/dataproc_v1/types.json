A field path is similar in syntax to a [google.protobuf.FieldMask][google.protobuf.FieldMask]. For example, a field path that references the zone field of a workflow template's cluster selector would be specified as ``placement.clusterSelector.zone``.  Also, field paths can reference fields using the following syntax:  -  Values in maps can be referenced by key:  -  labels['key'] -  placement.clusterSelector.clusterLabels['key'] -  placement.managedCluster.labels['key'] -  placement.clusterSelector.clusterLabels['key'] -  jobs['step-id'].labels['key']  -  Jobs in the jobs list can be referenced by step-id:  -  jobs['step-id'].hadoopJob.mainJarFileUri -  jobs['step-id'].hiveJob.queryFileUri -  jobs['step-id'].pySparkJob.mainPythonFileUri -  jobs['step-id'].hadoopJob.jarFileUris[0] -  jobs['step-id'].hadoopJob.archiveUris[0] -  jobs['step-id'].hadoopJob.fileUris[0] -  jobs['step-id'].pySparkJob.pythonFileUris[0]  -  Items in repeated fields can be referenced by a zero-based index:  -  jobs['step-id'].sparkJob.args[0]  -  Other examples:  -  jobs['step-id'].hadoopJob.properties['key'] -  jobs['step-id'].hadoopJob.args[0] -  jobs['step-id'].hiveJob.scriptVariables['key'] -  jobs['step-id'].hadoopJob.mainJarFileUri -  placement.clusterSelector.zone  It may not be possible to parameterize maps and repeated fields in their entirety since only individual map values and individual items in repeated fields can be referenced. For example, the following field paths are invalid:  -  placement.clusterSelector.clusterLabels -  jobs['step-id'].sparkJob.args",
