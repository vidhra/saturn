This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.  The `token bucket <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket>`__ algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by ``max_burst_size``. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue's bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on [max_dispatches_per_second][RateLimits.max_dispatches_per_second].  The default value of ``max_burst_size`` is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of [max_dispatches_per_second][RateLimits.max_dispatches_per_second].  The maximum value of ``max_burst_size`` is 500.  For App Engine queues that were created or updated using ``queue.yaml/xml``, ``max_burst_size`` is equal to `bucket_size <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size>`__.

Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task names, these [CreateTask][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.CloudTasks.CreateTask] calls have significantly increased latency. Using hashed strings for the task id or for the prefix of the task id is recommended.
