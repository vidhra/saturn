If [schedule_time][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.Task.schedule_time] is not set or is in the past then Cloud Tasks will set it to the current time.  Task De-duplication:  Explicitly specifying a task ID enables task de-duplication. If a task's ID is identical to that of an existing task or a task that was deleted or completed recently then the call will fail with [ALREADY_EXISTS][google.rpc.Code.ALREADY_EXISTS]. If the task's queue was created using Cloud Tasks, then another task with the same name can't be created for ~1 hour after the original task was deleted or completed. If the task's queue was created using queue.yaml or queue.xml, then another task with the same name can't be created for ~9 days after the original task was deleted or completed.  Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task names, these [CreateTask][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.CloudTasks.CreateTask] calls have significantly increased latency. Using hashed strings for the task id or for the prefix of the task id is recommended. Choosing task ids that are sequential or have sequential prefixes, for example using a timestamp, causes an increase in latency and error rates in all task commands. The infrastructure relies on an approximately uniform distribution of task ids to store and serve tasks efficiently."
