This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.  The `token bucket <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket>`__ algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by ``max_burst_size``. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue's bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on [max_dispatches_per_second][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.RateLimits.max_dispatches_per_second].

If [schedule_time][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.Task.schedule_time] is not set or is in the past then Cloud Tasks will set it to the current time.  Task De-duplication:  Explicitly specifying a task ID enables task de-duplication. If a task's ID is identical to that of an existing task or a task that was deleted or completed recently then the call will fail with [ALREADY_EXISTS][google.rpc.Code.ALREADY_EXISTS]. If the task's queue was created using Cloud Tasks, then another task with the same name can't be created for ~1 hour after the original task was deleted or completed. If the task's queue was created using queue.yaml or queue.xml, then another task with the same name can't be created for ~9 days after the original task was deleted or completed.  Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task names, these [CreateTask][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.CloudTasks.CreateTask] calls have significantly increased latency. Using hashed strings for the task id or for the prefix of the task id is recommended. Choosing task ids that are sequential or have sequential prefixes, for example using a timestamp, causes an increase in latency and error rates in all task commands. The infrastructure relies on an approximately uniform distribution of task ids to store and serve tasks efficiently.",
