For more information, see the Compute Engine section, `Checking whether nested virtualization is allowed <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/managing-constraint#checking_whether_nested_virtualization_is_allowed>`__. -  **Performance**: nested VMs might experience a 10% or greater decrease in performance for workloads that are CPU-bound and possibly greater than a 10% decrease for workloads that are input/output bound. -  **Machine Type**: nested virtualization can only be enabled on workstation configurations that specify a [machine_type][google.cloud.workstations.v1.WorkstationConfig.Host.GceInstance.machine_type] in the N1 or N2 machine series. -  **GPUs**: nested virtualization may not be enabled on workstation configurations with accelerators. -  **Operating System**: Because `Container-Optimized OS <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#container-optimized_os_cos>`__ does not support nested virtualization, when nested virtualization is enabled, the underlying Compute Engine VM instances boot from an `Ubuntu LTS <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#ubuntu_lts>`__ image.",
