Currently \"count\" and \"places\" insights\nare supported. With \"count\" insights you can answer questions\nsuch as \"How many restaurant are located in California that are\noperational, are inexpensive and have an average rating of at\nleast 4 stars\" (see ``insight`` enum for more details). With\n\"places\" insights, you can determine which places match the\nrequested filter.
