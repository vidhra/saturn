This matches the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions:  -  IPs are not allowed. -  A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (``*.``). The wildcard label must appear by itself as the first label.  Hostname can be \"precise\" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. ``foo.example.com``) or \"wildcard\", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. ``*.example.com``).  Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a label must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character. No other punctuation is allowed.  The routes associated with a Mesh or Gateway must have unique hostnames. If you attempt to attach multiple routes with conflicting hostnames, the configuration will be rejected.  For example, while it is acceptable for routes for the hostnames ``*.foo.bar.com`` and ``*.bar.com`` to be associated with the same route, it is not possible to associate two routes both with ``*.bar.com`` or both with ``bar.com``.  If a port is specified, then gRPC clients must use the channel URI with the port to match this rule (i.e. \"xds:///service:123\"), otherwise they must supply the URI without a port (i.e. \"xds:///service\")."
