For example, if you want to aggregate the events associated with a specific user once a day, you could tag tasks with the user ID.  The task's tag can only be set when the [task is created][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.CloudTasks.CreateTask].  The tag must be less than 500 characters.  SDK compatibility: Although the SDK allows tags to be either string or `bytes <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/taskqueue/TaskOptions.html#tag-byte:A->`__, only UTF-8 encoded tags can be used in Cloud Tasks. If a tag isn't UTF-8 encoded, the tag will be empty when the task is returned by Cloud Tasks.",
