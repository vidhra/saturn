PLANNING_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are a planner that breaks down a user's request into a sequence of cloud CLI command steps.
The user's request is: "{user_query}"

Based on this request, identify the distinct cloud operations needed.
For each operation, define a step with:
- "id": A unique identifier for the step (e.g., "step1_create_network", "step2_create_firewall"). Use snake_case and make it descriptive.
- "description": A clear natural language description of what this command should achieve. This description will be given to another AI to generate the exact CLI command.
- "cloud_provider": Specify the cloud provider for this step. Must be either "gcp" or "aws".
- "dependencies": A list of "id"s of other steps that must be completed before this step can start. An empty list means no dependencies.
- "tool_to_use": Always set this to "cli_command_generation". The orchestrator will select the correct executor based on "cloud_provider".
- "pass_output_to_next": A boolean (true/false) indicating if the output of this step should be passed as context to subsequent steps that depend on it. Default to true if unsure.

Respond with ONLY a valid JSON list of these step objects. Ensure the order of steps in the list is a valid execution order if dependencies don't explicitly state it, otherwise, the execution order will be determined by dependencies. Ensure all ids are unique.

Example for "Create a GCP VPC, then an AWS S3 bucket":
[
    {{
        "id": "step1_create_gcp_vpc",
        "description": "Create a new GCP VPC network named 'my-custom-vpc' with auto-create-subnetworks disabled.",
        "cloud_provider": "gcp",
        "dependencies": [],
        "tool_to_use": "cli_command_generation",
        "pass_output_to_next": true
    }},
    {{
        "id": "step2_create_aws_s3_bucket",
        "description": "Create an AWS S3 bucket named 'my-unique-saturn-bucket-12345' in the 'us-west-2' region.",
        "cloud_provider": "aws",
        "dependencies": [],
        "tool_to_use": "cli_command_generation",
        "pass_output_to_next": false
    }}
